Phải! Là dũng khí. Thứ dũng khí để thừa nhận như một thằng đàn ông đầu đội… vợ, chân đạp… bồ: Rằng anh chàng này đang làm lộ quá nhiều bí mật của cánh đàn ông. Chứ khi đọc bản thảo của anh chàng, tôi thật lòng muốn giấu nhẹm nó đi. Làm sao tôi có thể cho vợ tôi đọc cuốn sách này kia chứ? Nó quá nguy hiểm với cánh đàn ông chúng tôi! Nhưng đến lúc này (đến nước này) rồi thì tôi đành phải viết.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách này quả thực là quá “béo bở” với các chị em! Đây là một cuốn sách mà không ít chị em đã đọc và phong tặng nó là “Giải phẫu tim đen của đàn ông” hay “Đàn Ông Học Đại Cương”. Còn đàn ông đọc xong thì đòi tiêu hủy ngay vì nó làm lộ quá nhiều bí mật của đàn ông. Thật cũng không lạ vì nó được kiểm duyệt và oánh giá bởi hơn 200.000 bạn đọc của tờ tạp chí nữ giới danh tiếng: 2!ĐẸP.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sách gồm 2 phần và cả 2 phần đều phơi bày quá nhiều tim đen đàn ông. Nó cho phụ nữ thấy đàn ông thực sự nghĩ gì nhiều đến mức mà phụ nữ có thể khóc vì đôi lần quá quắt của mình. Tôi ngờ rằng người sẽ khóc nhiều nhất chính là một ai đó là nguyên mẫu (nguyên nhân) của anh chàng (tôi phải dùng từ ai đó để đảm bảo an toàn tính mạng cho tác giả trước vợ của anh ta). Đàn ông ghét cuốn sách này đến mức họ rồng rắn đi mua bằng sạch đợt in đầu. Tôi đã từng tưởng họ sẽ tiêu hủy hết, vậy mà ai dè vợ của lũ bạn tôi, ai cũng khoe trên Facebook rằng vừa được chồng tặng cuốn sách này. Vì sao thế? Là vì người ta yêu nhau nên người ta muốn đối phương hiểu người ta. Là vì các ông chồng đều muốn mượn anh chàng Đức Long này để “huấn thị” vợ. Kiểu: Đấy! Đàn ông nó nghĩ thế đấy! Nên nếu giả dụ chồng cũng nghĩ như thế thì vợ phải hiểu và thông cảm nhé!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phải! Bởi ẩn sau những than thở, tự thú, bóc mẽ, châm chọc… kia là khát khao gìn giữ cuộc hôn nhân này. Bởi người đàn ông trong mỗi câu chuyện, xét cho cùng, điều y muốn là một người vợ hiểu mình, trân quý mình, đồng cảm (và cả thông cảm) với mình. Y cũng như phụ nữ thôi, đều khát khao hạnh phúc. Chỉ là đàn ông ai lại sến súa nói ra. Bèn dùng khổ nhục kế để được yêu hơn vậy.Nhân đợt tái bản (chỉ sau chưa đầy một tháng xuất bản), thì vài lời dông dài gọi là chúc mừng sách bán chạy, chia vui với một cuốn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a> và góp lửa cho hôn nhân - <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> giữa đàn ông với đàn bà thêm đượm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Hoàng Anh TúTrưởng Ban Biên tập báo SVVN- HHT)</strong></p>', '2014-03-14', 0, 92, 7, 12, 'NXB Văn Học', 'null', NULL, 0, 60000, 75000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/xoa-het-dau-vet-truoc-khi-ve-nha_3.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Thế nên người ta mới bảo, phụ nữ và đàn ông dù có sống với nhau đến hai ngàn năm cũng không thể nào hiểu được nhau hoàn toàn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhưng có khi, chính vì không hiểu nổi nhau nên họ mới sống được cùng nhau hai ngàn năm. Ngược lại chỉ hai năm là chán phè.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách này chính là nói về cái sự không hiểu (hoặc không muốn hiểu) ấy.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“<a href="http://tiki.vn/xoa-het-dau-vet-truoc-khi-ve-nha-p76043.html">Xóa hết dấu vết trước khi về nhà</a></strong>” hoàn toàn không phải là một cuốn sách tâm lý về đàn ông và phụ nữ. Các bài viết trong đó bày tỏ góc nhìn hài hước của tác giả về cách hành xử của phụ nữ và giải thích theo cách của riêng mình. Tất cả những thói quen cư xử của phụ nữ được viết qua các câu chuyện dí dỏm, không triết lý nhưng khá nhiều thông điệp khiến bạn đọc tâm đắc. Hoặc về những điều “khó chịu một cách đáng yêu” của phụ nữ:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Phụ nữ tò mò muồn biết anh người yêu của mình có yêu mình thật không, yêu mình như thế nào, yêu sâu đậm hay hời hợt, có yêu mọi lúc mọi nơi không, có yêu đủ để vượt qua cả lúc bận bịu không, có yêu đủ để vẫn ngọt ngào với mình ngay cả khi anh ta vừa bị sếp đì không. Hơn nữa, có đủ yêu để vượt qua tình huống rất dễ mất kiên nhẫn vì bị hỏi đi hỏi lại một câu cũ mèm không. Vì là có thế này mà đã cáu, không biết chừng lấy nhau rồi thì ăn đá. Bởi một khi đã kết hôn, phụ nữ còn tò mò hơn nữa, hỏi nhiều hơn nữa”. (Anh có yêu em không?)</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Nên hai tiếng “Đừng anh!” sẽ vẫn là một thứ vũ khí tốt trong giai đoạn <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> lên đến cao trào. Nó giúp phụ nữ bớt ngượng ngùng, lại giúp đàn ông tiến dần theo từng bước. Nó giống như một account đã để ngỏ password, hoàn toàn chỉ còn cần dựa vào hơi thở để nhấn nút login”. (L’amour platonique và triết lí “Đừng anh”)</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hoặc khẳng định bản chất tử tế của đàn ông:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Đàn ông luôn thích các cô gái sống thoáng mà không dễ dãi, vì nhờ thế họ có mục đích để theo đuổi. Dù gì, tuyệt đại đa số đàn ông cũng là những sinh vật tử tế, họ mơ ước ôm ấp cái đích ấy, nhưng không bao giờ đánh đổi bằng mọi giá.” (Đường đến chiếc giường)</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Xóa hết dấu vết trước khi về nhà” sẽ là một món quà thú vị, nó giúp bạn làm tăng thêm sự...không hiểu nhau giữa hai phe (để có thể sống cùng nhau đến hai ngàn năm), nhưng ngược lại, cuốn sách này cũng giúp bạn biết rằng cái sự không hiểu nhau ấy chính là cục nam châm trái dấu, kết nối bền chặt hai trái tim lại với nhau.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Vì thế, hãy luôn vui vẻ tận hưởng. Cho dù có ai đó phải “<strong>xóa hết dấu vết trước khi về nhà”</strong>.</p>  <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Xóa Hết Dấu Vết Trước Khi Về Nhà" src="https://tikicdn.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/x/o/xoa-het-dau-vet-truoc-khi-ve-nha.jpg" alt="Xóa Hết Dấu Vết Trước Khi Về Nhà" width="588" height="838" /></p>', '2013-10-14', 1, 92, 7, 4, 'NXB Văn Học', 'null', 276, 3, 60000, 75000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img911_3.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Cha mẹ chỉ nên đứng từ xa, dùng <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> thương của mình để thắp lên ngọn lửa nghị lực, giúp con trưởng thành với một trái tim quả cảm, nhiệt thành và mạnh mẽ. Và như vậy, "tàn nhẫn" cũng là "yêu thương", một dạng thức yêu thương có trách nhiệm để đem lại cho gia đình một đứa con ngoan, và trao cho xã hội một công dân tốt.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sara Imas</strong> là một bà mẹ Trung Quốc mang trong mình dòng máu Do Thái. Sau khi quan hệ Trung Quốc - Israel được thiết lập, trước tiếng gọi trở về của cố hương, Sara đã từ bỏ cuộc sống an yên ở Thượng Hải, mang theo ba đứa con thơ để trở về Israel, nơi đồng bào của bà đang phải ngày ngày chịu đựng khói lửa chiến tranh, bắt đầu một trải nghiệm giáo dục đặc biệt của mình. Khác với tập 1, <strong>Vô cùng tàn nhẫn, vô cùng yêu thương tập 2</strong> đã đối chiếu một cách biệt lập giữa phương thức nuôi dạy con của người Trung Quốc và người Israel. Tác giả không ngần ngại phơi bày những bất cập vốn tồn tại đã lâu trong cách nuôi dạy con của người Trung Quốc, đồng thời nêu bật những quan điểm về tình mẫu tử, những giá trị thiết thực trong nền giáo dục Do Thái.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với những trải nghiệm trong môi trường sống mới này, Sara đã quyết tâm rũ bỏ hình tượng của một "bà mẹ trực thăng" luôn nuông chiều, quán xuyến mọi việc cho con để trở thành một bà mẹ lý trí, biết gửi gắm tình yêu con cái của mình dưới một vỏ bọc sắt đá, kiên trì và đầy tính cương quyết.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Làm mẹ chưa bao giờ là điều dễ dàng, đôi khi chúng ta phải mất cả đời để tìm ra con đường trở thành một người mẹ tốt. Mẹ không chỉ là một thiên chức mà còn là tấm gương về cách ứng xử. Hy vọng rằng cuốn sách này sẽ đem đến những phút giây trải nghiệm thú vị, những bài học quý giá và một góc nhìn khác về tình yêu thương cho các bậc cha mẹ Việt Nam trong quá trình nuôi dưỡng những mầm xanh của mình.</p>', '2015-12-14', 1, 348, 9, 19, 'NXB Dân Trí', 'null', 331, 9, 79000, 99000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img312_1_13.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Đáng thương cho tấm lòng cha mẹ trong thiên hạ, nếu không học cách nuôi dạy con đúng đắn thì chắc chắn sẽ chuốc lấy hậu quả đáng sợ và đáng hận. “Con muốn học mà cha mẹ không dạy” cũng bi thương như “con muốn nuôi, mà cha mẹ chẳng còn”. Vậy cha mẹ cần dạy dỗ con một cách khoa học như thế nào?

Sử gia <strong>Niall Ferguson</strong> lập luận rằng bắt đầu vào thế kỉ 15, phương Tây đã phát triển sáu khái niệm mới đầy uy lực - cạnh tranh, khoa học, pháp quyền, y học hiện đại, chủ nghĩa tiêu dùng và đạo lý nghề nghiệp - cho phép họ vượt qua tất cả các đối thủ cạnh tranh khác.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhưng giờ đây, <strong>Ferguson</strong> cho thấy phần còn lại của thế giới đã tiếp thu tất cả các khái niệm mà phương Tây từng độc chiếm, trong khi phương Tây lại đang đánh mất niềm tin vào chính mình. Ghi lại sự hưng thịnh và suy tàn của các đế chế cùng với những cuộc va chạm (và giao hòa) của những nền văn minh, <strong>Văn Minh Phương Tây Và Phần Còn Lại Của Thế Giới</strong> đã đúc kết lại lịch sử thế giới, và đây được coi là cuốn sách xuất sắc nhất của <strong>Niall Ferguson</strong>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Câu hỏi chủ đạo mà cuốn sách này đề cập chính là câu hỏi lý thú nhất mà một nhà sử học nghiên cứu về kỷ nguyên hiện đại có thể đặt ra. Tại sao bắt đầu từ khoảng những năm 1500, vài ba quốc gia nhỏ bé miền viễn Tây của liên lục địa Âu-Á lại có thể nổi lên nắm quyền thống trị phần còn lại của thế giới, trong đó có cả những xã hội nằm ở phía đông lục địa Âu-Á vốn đông dân hơn và tinh tế hơn xét về nhiều mặt?</p>', '2016-12-14', 0, 296, 9, 7, 'NXB Hồng Đức', 'null', 480, 0, 151000, 189000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/van-minh-phuong-tay_outline_12-12-2016-03.u2469.d20170105.t143152.936665.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Đây không phải là sách sấm truyền. Là một nhà tương lai học, cố vấn cho chính phủ Hoa Kỳ, James Cantons viết cuốn sách này nhằm giúp người ta có sự chuẩn bị và hiểu biết mới mẻ về những thay đổi chóng mặt xảy ra và những hiểm họa mới. Triển khai những vấn đề chính yếu ở tương lai: năng lượng trong một thế giới đang cạn kiệt dầu mỏ, nền kinh tế cách tân, lực lượng lao động khi tỷ lệ sinh giảm và tuổi thọ tăng, y khoa để kéo dài cuộc sống, sự va chạm của các nền văn hóa, khoa học kỳ dị và tương lai của Mỹ/Trung Quốc trong một thế giới toàn cầu hóa.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Tương lai Khác thường</span> nói với chúng ta rằng những gì thành công ở hôm nay sẽ không tiếp tục thành công ở tương lai.

Và thế là, tạm biệt nhé - những ngày làm việc 8 tiếng đồng hồ nặng nhọc</em>!</p>  <p>Cuốn sách THE 4-HOUR WORK WEEK đã làm dấy lên một làn sóng tư tưởng mới mẻ tại thung lũng Silicon. Marc Andreesen - chuyên gia về tối ưu hoá năng suất làm việc cá nhân đồng thời là một trong những <a href="http://tiki.vn/doanh-nhan/c483">doanh nhân</a> nổi tiếng nhất ở trung tâm công nghệ cao của thế giới trong một bài phỏng vấn cho biết: "Về cơ bản, việc Tim đã làm là tập hợp và chắt lọc những học thuyết về quản lý thời gian cùng năng suất lao động trong vòng 2, 3 thập kỷ vừa qua, sau đó tối ưu hoá nó và đưa ra những khái niệm mới, rất hữu dụng".<br /><strong><em></em></strong></p>  <p><em>Bí quyết mà tác giả phát hiện ra được gói gọn trong chữ DEAL tương ứng với bốn bước:</em><br /><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>D: Definition </strong>(Xác định) Trong bước này Tim Ferriss giúp bạn thay đổi hoàn toàn những suy nghĩ sai lầm và đưa ra những qui tắc và mục đích của một phương pháp mới. Bạn sẽ có câu trả lời cho câu hỏi những nhà giàu mới (new rich) là ai và họ hành động như thế nào.</p>  <p><strong>E: Elimination </strong>(Loại bỏ) Giết chết những quan điểm lỗi thời về cách quản lí thời gian. Bằng cách sử dụng những kĩ thuật khác thường của những nhà giàu mới: áp dụng “sự thờ ơ có chọn lựa” – loại bỏ những thứ rườm rà không cần thiết, chỉ chuyên tâm vào những việc thực sự quan trọng, bạn có thể tăng năng suất lao động lên ít nhất mười lần. Phần này cũng giải thích nhân tố đầu tiên tạo nên một phong cách sống sung túc, đó là thời gian.</p>  <p><strong>A: Automation </strong>(Tự động hóa) Có những phương pháp nào khiến tiền của cứ thế tự động chảy vào túi bạn? Trong bước này bạn sẽ tiếp tục tìm hiểu về thu nhập (income): nhân tố thứ hai tạo nên một phong cách sống sung túc, thoải mái và đâu là điểm khác nhau chính giữa thu nhập tương đối và thu nhập tuyệt đối?<br /><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong>L: Liberation </strong>(Tự do) đây là bản tuyên ngôn về tính lưu động. Bạn sẽ học được cách điều khiển công việc từ xa trong khi đang ở trong kì nghỉ. “Tự do” ở đây không có nghĩa là các kì nghỉ rẻ tiền, nó ám chỉ cách bạn thoát khỏi các mối quan hệ ràng buộc bạn với một địa điểm cố định. Phần này cũng đề cập đến nhân tố cuối cùng tạo nên một cuộc sống thoải mái: tính lưu động (mobility).</p>  <p>Ngoài rất nhiều ý kiến khen ngợi, đồng tình với những bí quyết này, cũng có một số ý kiến phản đối khá gay gắt. Có người cho rằng cuốn sách đang cố rao giảng một thứ phương châm sống không còn mới mẻ: “Tận hưởng cuộc sống ngay khi bạn còn có thể.” (Đã được Thoreau đưa ra cách đấy 2 thế kỷ!) Và đưa ra giải pháp để có thể thực hiện lối sống “nhàn hạ” đó là bằng cách thuê làm bên ngoài (outsource) tất cả những công việc có thể, do vậy bạn giảm thiểu những việc bạn phải làm và nhờ đó có thời gian để hưởng thụ cuộc sống.</p>  <p>Những độc giả này lập luận rằng: như vậy, thực ra chẳng có công việc nào mất đi cả, nó chỉ được thực hiện bởi những người khác mà thôi. Và nếu ai cũng làm theo lời khuyên của Tim Ferriss thì cuối cùng ai sẽ là người làm những việc đó?</p>  <p>Thêm nữa, bí quyết làm giàu mà Tim Ferriss cung cấp trong quyển sách này tập trung vào việc thành lập một doanh nghiệp điện tử, làm giàu nhờ kinh doanh qua mạng (công thức phổ biến giúp làm nên các nhà giàu mới). Công thức này khó có thể áp dụng cho mọi người, vì không phải ai cũng được thông minh và có điều kiện tốt như Ferriss.</p>  <p>Những luồng dư luận có vẻ “đối nhau chan chát” với cuốn sách cũng là điều dễ hiểu, bởi không có gì là hoàn toàn tuyệt đối, cũng như Tim Ferriss không tham vọng khiến cả thế giới được “xả hơi thoải mái” chỉ nhờ cuốn sách của anh.</p>  <p>Điều đáng ghi nhận nhất ở đây có lẽ là đa số các độc giả đều đánh giá cao cuốn sách của Tim Ferriss với nhận xét: cuốn sách có lối viết kiểu tự sự dễ đọc, bố cục mạch lạc dễ hiểu và đã cung cấp rất nhiều thủ thuật hay giúp những người làm công việc công sở tiết kiệm thời gian và giảm stress (ví dụ thủ thuật kiểm tra và trả lời email 2 lần một ngày vào những giờ xác định). Họ cũng cho rằng cuốn sách giúp họ thiết lập một cuộc sống “ngăn nắp hơn” và vui vẻ hơn nhiều.</p>  <p>Và điều đó thêm một lần nữa khẳng định thêm: mọi bí quyết chỉ là bí quyết, còn áp dụng như thế nào, tùy thuộc hoàn toàn vào bạn, mà khởi đầu cho tất cả, bạn cứ tự nhủ với mình rằng: có thể làm nó tốt đẹp và ổn thỏa hơn hiện tại rất nhiều lần!</p>', '2015-12-14', 0, 395, 16, 11, 'NXB Lao Động Xã Hội', 'null', 356, 1, 68000, 85000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img893_3_4.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Thế nhưng về lâu về dài việc hỏi ý kiến những người xung quanh sẽ dẫn bạn đi theo lối mòn đã mở sẵn, một tư duy kém đổi mới mà nếu tự suy ngẫm, theo một hướng khác hơn, đột phá hơn, lập dị hơn, bạn sẽ mở ra một hướng giải quyết thông minh hơn và khôn ngoan hơn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuốn sách Tư duy như một kẻ lập dị, Steve D.Levitt &amp; Steph J.Dubner, đồng tác giả của hai cuốn sách vô cùng lý thú pha chút hóm hỉnh Kinh tế học hài hước và Siêu kinh tế học hài hước, sẽ một lần nữa dùng lối văn phong phá cách của mình để “mở khóa tư duy” của độc giả. Xin nhắc lại đây không phải là một cuốn sách hài hước, đơn giản chỉ là để giải trí, mà ngoài những yếu tố, những ví dụ vui nhộn, hai tác giả này còn muốn người đọc có được một thái độ tích cực hơn với những gì bất ngờ xảy đến, hãy luôn thoát khỏi lối mòn và trang bị cho mình những cách giải thích đơn giản nhất có thể.</p>', '2016-02-14', 0, 361, 9, 5, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 267, 1, 79000, 99000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img307.gif', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Đặc biệt, trong ký ức của nhiều người trưởng thành 30 - 40 tuổi hiện nay, tuổi trẻ của họ từng có hình bóng Tôn Nữ Thị Ninh trong các buổi giao lưu trò chuyện cùng sinh viên, thanh niên như một người truyền lửa nhiệt huyết. Họ cảm phục bà ở chiều sâu uyên bác và thái độ chia sẻ ân cần, thiện cảm. </span>Sức hấp dẫn bắt nguồn từ sự cuốn hút của một con người hội tụ nhiều phẩm chất tự thân lẫn có được nhờ nền học vấn quốc tế. Hấp dẫn còn nhờ năng lượng tỏa ra từ một phụ nữ cả cuộc đời cố gắng vì những mục tiêu tiến bộ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách này sẽ giúp độc giả hình dung rõ nét hơn chân dung của nhà ngoại giao, nhà giáo, nhà hoạt động văn hóa Tôn Nữ Thị Ninh với đầy đủ quá trình sự nghiệp. Những bài phát biểu, trả lời phỏng vấn, nội dung nói chuyện, giao lưu... được chọn lọc theo các cụm chủ đề: <strong>Tản mạn, Việt Nam và thế giới, Xã hội</strong> và sắp xếp theo trình tự thời gian. Trong các bài viết của mình, Tôn Nữ Thị Ninh luôn nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của các nền văn hóa, xem đây như nền tảng then chốt cho xây dựng vị thế đất nước: "Văn hóa ban cho ta tính người". Người đọc cũng có thể tìm thấy và lựa chọn những thông điệp, thông tin, kiến thức... có giá trị tham khảo riêng cho bản thân.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong một lần giao lưu với sinh viên cách đây hơn một thập niên, khi được hỏi: "Điều khó khăn nhất của phụ nữ khi làm ngoại giao là gì?", Tôn Nữ Thị Ninh đã trả lời: "Là không được rơi lệ!". Câu trả lời thể hiện phần cảm xúc nhân văn ẩn sau vẻ ngoài "thép" lạnh lùng, tỉnh táo của một người dấn thân vào lĩnh vực ngoại giao. Đây cũng chính là thông điệp mà cuốn<strong> Tư duy và chia sẻ</strong> muốn gửi đến độc giả:<em> "Hãy sống trung thực, tự trọng, dấn thân với xã hội và đất nước... sự thờ ơ còn tồi tệ hơn sự thiếu hiểu biết"  (Tôn Nữ Thị Ninh)</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sách có kèm DVD ghi lại những cuộc trò chuyện, phát biểu, phỏng vấn của bà trong nước và quốc tế như một tặng phẩm đặc biệt gửi đến độc giả.</p>', '2015-03-14', 0, 397, 6, 35, 'NXB Trẻ', 'null', 414, 5, 98000, 140000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/tu-duy-va-chia-se_1.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Bueno de Mesquita sử dụng lý thuyết trò chơi và khả năng nhìn thấu hành vi con người của nó để dự đoán, và thậm chí định trước các sự kiện chính trị, tài chính hay những gì xảy ra trong cuộc sống hàng ngày. Dự báo của ông đã được mọi giới sử dụng, từ CIA đến các công ty lớn, và có tỷ lệ chính xác đáng ngạc nhiên, lên đến 90%.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuốn sách gây kinh ngạc và tiết lộ nhiều điều này, ông chia sẻ với chúng ta phương pháp đáng sửng sốt của mình và cho phép bạn cùng tham gia dự đoán một loạt các tình huống đàm phán và tranh chấp có mức độ ảnh hưởng cao.Sử dụng quan điểm gốc của lý thuyết trò chơi cộng với những phát triển của John Nash, nhà khoa học đã được trao giải Nobel và có lẽ được biết đến nhiều nhất qua bộ phim Một tâm hồn đẹp, Bueno de Mesquita mô tả chi tiết hệ thống tính toán tỉnh táo lạnh lùng và gây nhiều tranh cãi mà ông đã xây dựng nên. Hệ thống này cho phép chúng ta suy nghĩ một cách có chiến lược về mong muốn của đối phương, họ muốn điều đó đến mức nào, và họ sẽ phản ứng ra sao trước mỗi nước cờ. Từ đây, Bueno de Mesquita chơi trò dự đoán những sự kiện như đàm phán giải trừ quân bị ở Bắc Triều Tiên, quá trình tiến bộ và tan vỡ của nền hòa bình Trung Đông cùng với nhiều tình huống khác, trong đó ông đã dự đoán chính xác khách hàng nào của công ty kiểm toán Arthur Andersen có nhiều khả năng gian lận nhất (gợi ý: tên công ty này bắt đầu bằng chữ E).

Cuốn sách này sẽ dần hé lộ những bí ẩn về sự thông thái của người Do Thái, của một dân tộc thông tuệ với những phương pháp và kỹ thuật phát triển tầng lớp trí thức đã được giữ kín hàng nghìn năm như một bí ẩn mật mang tính văn hóa.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong quá khứ, và thậm chí cả ngày nay nữa, người Do Thái luôn được gắn với phẩm chất về chất xám và trí tuệ. Thuật ngữ "Bộ óc Do Thái", dùng để chỉ một người nào đó thật thông thái, đã trở thành cụm từ được sử dụng bởi cả những người Do Thái và người không theo đạo Do Thái.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ở thời Trung đại, 17,6% trong số những nhà khoa học hàng đầu là người Do Thái, và ở đó, họ chỉ chiếm 1,0% dân số nói chung. Nói cách khác, số nhà khoa học người Do Thái nhiều gấp 18 lần con số người ta thường nghĩ đến. Hiện nay, 1/3 số triệu phú Mỹ là người Do Thái. 20% số giáo sư tại các trường đại học hàng đầu của Mỹ là người Do Thái.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Không còn nghi ngờ gì nữa, Do Thái có lẽ là dân tộc giàu có nhất trên thế giới nếu tính đến tài năng. Những cái tên Do Thái có tầm ảnh hưởng đến toàn thể nhân loại luôn nằm trên đầu các danh sách ở hầu hết mọi lĩnh vực: Tư tưởng, chính trị, văn học, âm nhạc cổ điển, giải trí, công nghiệp điện ảnh và kinh doanh.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Và đây là điều cực kỳ đặc biệt: <em>"Người Do Thái có một trí tưởng tượng đặc biệt. Họ phát triển khái niệm về Chúa với hình thức thực tại. Họ có kiểu Chúa khác. Tôi muốn nói với các bạn rằng họ đã tạo ra chúa. Mọi thứ bắt nguồn từ đó"</em>.</p>', '2015-04-14', 1, 102, 9, 21, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 408, 20, 87000, 109000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img168_-_copy.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Tác giả dành chương cuối (chương 9) để bàn về vấn đề toàn cầu hoá trong thời đại khoa học công nghệ, đặc biệt là tin học và truyền thông đại chúng lan tràn đã tác động mạnh mẽ đến dư luận, các nhà lãnh đạo và các quyết định chính trị hiện nay.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Theo cách nhìn của Kissinger thì trật tự thế giới ngày nay cần được đặt trên hai yếu tố căn bản:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Nguyên tắc tôn trọng chủ quyền của mỗi quốc gia có tính chính danh dựa trên căn bản của các hiệp ước và tổ chức quốc tế;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Và để đảm bảo duy trì hòa bình và ổn định trên thế giới cũng như các khu vực, cần phải dựa trên một sự cân bằng quyền lực mà chủ yếu phụ thuộc vào các cường quốc thế giới và khu vực.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Để có một trật tự quốc tế tồn tại và bền vững, Kissinger cho rằng nó phải liên quan đến "quyền lực có tính chính danh." Tới cuối cùng, Kissinger, con người thực tế và nổi tiếng, lại có vẻ duy tâm đến mức ngạc nhiên. Thậm chí khi có những sự xung đột giữa các giá trị Mỹ và các mục tiêu khác, ông khích lệ chúng ta hãy tiếp tục đứng lên vì những giá trị đó, không lẩn tránh; đi đầu trong việc trợ giúp các quốc gia dân tộc, các lực lượng chính danh, chứ không chỉ các chính phủ đơn độc, nếu những sự trợ giúp ấy đảm bảo cho cán cân quyền lực có thể chống đỡ trật tự quốc tế, cũng như những giá trị và nguyên tắc của chúng ta có thể được những người khác chấp nhận và hấp dẫn họ. - <strong><a href="https://tiki.vn/chuyen-ke-ve-danh-nhan-the-gioi-hillary-clinton-p93850.html">Hillary Clinton</a></strong></em></p>', '2016-12-14', 0, 132, 9, 37, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 452, 11, 151000, 189000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/trat-tu-the-gioi_outline_15-12-2016-03.u2469.d20170105.t142407.157069.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Quỹ Totto Foundation đào tạo các diễn viên điếc một cách chuyên nghiệp, nhằm hiện thực hoá ý tưởng mang hát kịch đến với những người điếc của Kuroyanagi.</p>  <p>Năm 1984, , bà được bổ nhiệm làm Đại sứ Thiện chí của Quỹ Nhi đồng Liên hiệp quốc, và là người châu Á đầu tiên ở vị trí này. Trong những năm cuối thập kỉ 80 và thập kỉ 90, bà đã đến thăm rất nhiều quốc gia đang phát triển ở châu Á và châu Phi để làm từ thiện và thực hiện các nhiệm vụ thiện chí, giúp đỡ trẻ em đang phải chịu cảnh thiên tai và chiến tranh, đồng thời nâng cao sự chú ý của quốc tế đối với trẻ em ở những nước nghèo. Kuroyanagi quyên góp được hơn 20 triệu đô cho các chương trình của UNICEF mà bà có tham gia hoạt động qua các chiến dịch quyên góp trên truyền hình. Bà cũng ủng hộ tiền bản quyền của cuốn sách Totto-chan cho UNICEF.</p>  <p>Năm 1997, Kuroyanagi xuất bản cuốn sách Những đứa trẻ của Totto-chan, dựa trên những trải nghiệm khi bà làm Đại sứ Thiện chí của UNICEF từ năm 1984 đến năm 1996.</p>  <p>Ngoài ra, Kuroyanagi còn là Giám đốc khu vực Nhật Bản của quỹ Bảo tồn Thiên nhiên Thế giới (WWF).</p>  <p>Với những thành tựu trong lĩnh vực truyền thông và truyền hình, Kuroyanagi đã giành giải thưởng Japanese Cultural Broadcasting, được coi là niềm vinh dự cao nhất trong giới truyền hình Nhật Bản. Sau đó, bà đã được đề cử 14 lần cho danh hiệu nhân vật truyền hình được yêu thích nhất Nhật Bản.</p>  <p>Năm 2000, Kuroyanagi là người đầu tiên nhận giải Global Leadership for Children được thành lập bởi UNICEF nhân kỉ niệm 10 năm ngày Hội nghị Thượng đỉnh Thế giới về Trẻ em năm 1990.</p>  <p>Tháng 5/2003, Kuroyanagi nhận Huân chương Thuỵ Bảo của Nhật Hoàng vì những cống hiến của bà cho trẻ em thế giới trong suốt hai thập kỉ.</p>  <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Đặc biệt:</span> Với mỗi cuốn sách "Totto-chan bên cửa sổ" bán được sẽ <strong>trích ra 10.000 đồng để gửi tới các em nhỏ Nhật Bản là nạn nhân trực tiếp và gián tiếp của thảm họa thiên nhiên vừa qua</strong>.</p>', '2013-12-14', 0, 184, 17, 12, 'NXB Văn Học', 'Trương Thùy Lan', 355, 5, 64000, 80000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/totto-chan_2.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Là bậc thầy hướng dẫn đời sống tâm linh, pháp sư không chỉ bàn luận đến thành công và trưởng thành của mỗi cá nhân mà còn mở rộng tầm nhìn cho mỗi người.... Ngài cho rằng trưởng thành của mỗi cá nhân chính là sự trưởng thành của cả nhân loại, thành công của cá nhân chính là thành công của toàn xã hội, cá nhân và tập thể không mẫu thuẫn đối lập mà tác động qua lại, bổ trợ cho nhau. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Tìm lại chính mình là kết tinh của tâm từ mẫn, trí xuất trần giúp chúng ta tìm lại nẻo về bản lai diện mục, đối diện với chính mình.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Trích đoạn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a>:</strong></span></span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">"...Trong cuộc sống hối hả, bận bịu, bạn đã từng suy tư về ý nghĩa và giá trị của cuộc sống? Có phải là để kiếm kế sinh nhai, kiếm quần áo mặc? Hay là để cầu tài, cầu danh, cạnh tranh với người khác?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nhiều người tham sống sợ chết, tham danh cầu lợi, tranh đoạt... từng ngày trôi đi. Nhìn thấy mọi người muốn, tôi cũng muốn, mọi người không muốn, tôi cũng không thèm. Cho rằng cái mà mọi người đều muốn, đó phải là cái tốt đẹp, vì vậy tranh nhau cướp lấy, tuy mình chưa từng nghĩ bản thân thực sự cần cái đó? Dù sao mọi người đều muốn thì tôi cũng muốn, mọi người không cần thì mình lập tức vứt nó đi, bởi vì mọi người đã không cần, tôi vẫn muốn nó làm gì nữa?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Giống như con kiến, thông thường chúng chỉ cần những thứ mà chúng cảm thấy ngon, các chú kiến khác lần lượt sẽ vây quanh để cùng đi. Nhưng đó không phải là hành vi của con người. Con người cần có quan niệm rằng "Cái tôi cần chưa chắc người khác cần, cái người khác muốn chưa chắc là cái tôi muốn" đó mới chính là nhân cách độc lập đích thực. Tuy nhiên, đa số mọi người đều thích a dua theo người khác, đó là một hiện tượng đáng buồn.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Một người nếu sống không có mục đích, nhất định sẽ cảm thấy vô cùng trống rỗng, cảm thấy cuộc đời không có giá trị gì, giống như cái xác không hồn.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nhưng mỗi một mạng sống con người đều có nhân quả, đều quý giá tượng trưng cho ý nghĩa nào đó. Vậy, mục đích sự sống con người l&agravagrave; gì? Cuối cùng sẽ đi về đâu? Sẽ trở thành cái gì?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Theo quan điểm Phật giáo, cuộc sống của người phàm là để thụ báo và trả nợ. Phật, Bồ Tát ứng thế để thực hiện hoài bão độ sinh. Nếu nhận thức được thân thể con người quý báu không dễ gì có được, có thể biết được điều thiện và điều ác, vì cái thiện mà xua đi cái ác, cuộc sống con người sẽ có ý nghĩa. Nếu từng bước cống hiến tích cực, đem lợi cho mình và người khác, thì cuộc sống có giá trị biết bao.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">"Thụ báo" là: Chúng ta cần phải chịu trách nhiệm về những hành vi chúng ta làm, nói năng, suy nghĩ. Cuộc đời chúng ta là quá trình tự làm tự chịu, những điều mà chúng ta đã làm và những hành vi thiện ác của cuộc đời, kết hợp tạo thành cuộc đời hiện tại của một con người, đó chính nguyên nhân tồn tại của sự sống con người.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Có nhiều hiện tượng thoạt nhìn chúng ta thấy bất công, và chúng ta cũng không có cách nào giải quyết. Ví dụ có người rất cố gắng, nhưng không thành công, có người chẳng cần cố gắng vẫn thuận buồm xuôi gió, luôn gặp may mắn. Nhưng chúng ta thấy bất công. Để trả lời câu hỏi này chúng ta cần truy nguyên quá khứ, tìm về nguyên nhân sâu xa trong quá khứ vô tận, những hành vi mà chúng ta đã làm, những thứ vẫn chưa báo có thể sẽ báo lại trong đời hiện tại, hoặc có thể báo trong đời sống tương lai khác. Hơn nữa những hành vi mà mình làm, có cái tốt, cũng có cái xấu, tạo nghiệp tốt sẽ nhận được phúc báo, tạo nghiệp ác sẽ chịu đau khổ.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Giá trị cuộc sống con người là gì? Nhiều người cho rằng giá trị cuộc sống của con người là có tiền bạc, có địa vị, có danh lợi, được người khác tôn trọng. Ví dụ, thăng quan tiến chức, áo gấm vinh quy khiến cho người thân, hàng xóm và bạn bè ở quê thơm lây, không những thể hiện giá trị của cá nhân, mà cả quê hương, gia đình cũng hưởng phúc theo. Tuy nhiên đó phải chăng là giá trị đích thực?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Giá trị đích thực không phải là hư vinh của dòng họ gia tộc mà nó nằm ở những cống hiến thiết thực của bạn. Nếu bạn là người đầu cơ mưu lợi, tranh giành quyền thế danh lợi, dù lúc đó sẽ rất tự hào vẫn cũng không phải là giá trị đích thực. Bởi giá trị đó là mặt trái của nó, tạo ác nghiệp, tương lai bạn sẽ phải trả nợ theo nhân xác đã gieo đó.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Vì vậy, chúng ta có thể nói rằng: có bao nhiêu sự cống hiến sẽ có bấy nhiêu giá trị. Ví dụ, trong thời gian này tôi đang giảng về Phật pháp cho mọi người, đó chính là giá trị của tôi. Nếu trong thời gian này, tôi đang ngủ, ăn cơm hay cãi nhau với người khác, thì tôi chẳng tạo ra giá trị gì cả. Giá trị của cuộc sống chính là việc tạo ra những điều có lợi cho người khác, hơn nữa nó có lợi đối với sự trưởng thành của chính mình.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chúng ta có thể lập thệ nguyện cho đời mình. Nguyện vọng đó dù lớn dù nhỏ, có thể chỉ là sự cầu nguyện: "Cả đời này của tôi chỉ muốn làm người tốt" cầu nguyện trong cuộc đời này, mình không làm điều xấu, không lười biếng, không đầu cơ mưu lợi, tận tâm tận lực với trách nhiệm của mình. Cho dù cả đời này làm không tốt cũng không sao, bởi vẫn còn cuộc sống mới để nỗ lực. Cuộc đời như vậy, mới có giá trị, có ý nghĩa và tràn đầy hi vọng."</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #008000;">Về tác giả</span>: </strong></span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Pháp sư Thánh Nghiêm (1930-2009)</strong> xuất gia từ năm 13 tuổi.

Từ nỗi sợ phải nói tiếng Anh trước đám đông, nỗi sợ phải thuyết trình bằng tiếng Anh đến sự cố dẫn chương trình bằng tiếng Anh thất bại, Thùy Trang đã vượt qua và không chỉ thành công trong vai trò MC của nhiều chương trình, có những bài thuyết trình khiến nhiều bạn bè phải ngưỡng mộ. Từ nỗi sợ mình nhút nhát, nhạy cảm, không phù hợp với các vị trí đứng đầu một nhóm, một tổ chức, Thùy Trang đã trải qua vai trò là leader của một câu lạc bộ lên đến hàng trăm người, leader của những nhóm thuyết trình trong quá trình du học nước ngoài và cuối cùng là người điều hành một trung tâm tiếng Anh do chính mình lập ra.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuốn sách của mình, tác giả chia sẻ những thất bại, những điểm yếu của bản thân. Nhưng quan trọng hơn hết thảy, cô không tìm cách trốn tránh. Bài học lớn nhất mà cô chỉ ra là dám đối mặt với nỗi sợ hãi, với những điểm yếu của mình, bình tĩnh suy nghĩ và tìm ra những điểm mạnh của bản thân, dùng những “vũ khí” ấy để chuẩn bị kĩ càng trước bất kì vấn đề gì.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chiến thắng sự tự ti, nỗi sợ hãi của bản thân bằng cách tìm ra giải pháp cho những vấn đề mình gặp phải thay vì trốn tránh. Đừng để nỗi sợ hãi nhấn chìm mình, đừng để nỗi sợ hãi biến bạn thành bé nhỏ, thu mình vào một góc, mà hãy dùng nỗi sợ hãi đó như một động lực để nỗ lực hết sức, hết mình và tìm ra giải pháp để giải quyết vấn đề.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Giá trị cuối cùng bạn đạt được không phải là một cái đích đã được định sẵn hay những gì bạn đạt được. Đó lại là những gì bạn đã trải qua trên hành trình và sự thay đổi nội tại đến từ bên trong bạn. Bạn không thể chiến thắng thế giới, nhưng bạn có thể chiến thắng chính mình.

Ông là hình mẫu thành đạt mà nhiều người trong xã hội hướng tới. Nhưng trong những con người mẫu mực dường như luôn ẩn chứa những bế tắc. Chuyện ngoại tình của nhà phê bình là tâm điểm của <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-truyen-tieng-viet/sach-van-hoc.html">tiểu thuyết</a> <strong>Tiếng cười trong bóng tối</strong>. Bruno trở thành nạn nhân của những đam mê bị kìm nén do chính mình tạo ra. Để rồi, ông rơi vào bẫy của cặp tình nhân trẻ tuổi. Họ biến ông thành diễn viên chính trong vở hài kịch mà họ vừa là đạo diễn vừa là khán giả. Cuộc đời Bruno kết thúc trong thảm họa đúng như tác giả đã báo trước ngay đầu tác phẩm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ngoại tình vốn là câu chuyện đầy rẫy trong đời thường, và là đề tài quen thuộc trong văn chương. Nhưng <strong>Tiếng cười trong bóng tối</strong> đã kể một câu chuyện ngoại tình với tất cả chiều sâu nội tâm phức tạp, đầy màu sắc trong diễn biến được xem là phổ biến đến tẻ nhạt. Bằng cách sử dụng ngôn ngữ bậc thầy, tác giả đẩy giác quan người đọc đến cấp độ nhạy cảm nhất, đưa tới một trải nghiệm về nỗi thống khổ hài hước của con người.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu như<strong> Lolita</strong> được tác giả<strong> Vladimir Nabokov</strong> dịch từ tiếng Anh sang tiếng Nga, thì <strong>Tiếng cười trong bóng tối</strong> lại được dịch từ tiếng Nga sang tiếng Anh.

Không biết tiếng Anh thì không có tương lai.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Như chúng ta đã biết, tỷ lệ dân số nói tiếng Anh chiếm 20% tổng dân số thế giới, vì vậy tiếng Anh đã thực sự trở thành ngôn ngữ toàn cầu. Trong thời buổi hiện nay, những người có năng lực nhưng không biết tiếng Anh sẽ không được coi trọng, và tìm việc sẽ khó khăn hơn nhiều.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Liệu chúng ta có thể giỏi tiếng Anh được không? Câu trả lời là có. Nhưng chính phương thức học vẹt ngữ pháp và từ vựng mà chúng ta được dạy ở trường tiểu học, trung học, đại học lại trở thành chướng ngại cho chính việc học giao tiếp tiếng Anh.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đã là tiếng Anh thì hoặc là bạn phải cắn răng mà lao vào học hoặc là bạn sẽ phải từ bỏ. Học giao tiếp tiếng Anh cũng giống như dòng nước đang trôi vậy. Bạn không cần phải cố gắng học thuộc càng nhiều càng tốt một cách thụ động như ở trường. Mỗi ngày bạn hãy đọc một câu tiếng Anh rồi bắt chước theo, như vậy dần dần bạn sẽ làm chủ được nó. Đừng nghĩ bạn có thể đạt được thứ gì một cách dễ dàng trong chốc lát. Người Mỹ cũng là do sử dụng tiếng Anh thường xuyên mới quen và thành thạo được. Người Mỹ có câu “Nothing comes from nothing”nghĩa là nếu không bắt tay vào làm thì chúng ta sẽ luôn dậm chân tại chỗ mà thôi. Nếu chúng ta sợ khổ sợ khó mà không chịu thử sức thì sẽ không đạt được gì hết.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong thời gian ở Việt Nam, tác giả cuốn sách này đã nói chuyện với nhiều sinh viên và người đi làm. Họ đều có một mong muốn giống nhau là giỏi tiếng Anh. Tuy nhiên, họ thật sự không biết phải học như thế nào.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hiện nay ởViệt Nam có khá nhiều cuốn sách tiếng Anh được ra mắt mỗi tháng. Nhưng vô hình chung, cũng chính vì có nhiều cuốn sách tiếng Anh trên thị trường mà chúng ta lại gặp phải một vấn đề là không biết nên lựa chọn cuốn sách nào. Một cuốn sách mà có quá nhiều từ vựng khó thì đương nhiên không phải là cuốn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a>. Một cuốn sách mà sau khi đọc có thể học được các mẫu câu một cách tự nhiên nhất mới chính là cuốn sách hữu ích với bạn.</p>  <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://tikicdn.com/media/catalog/product/t/i/tieng-anh.png" alt="https://tikicdn.com/media/catalog/product/t/i/tieng-anh.png" width="563" height="450" /></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mỗi ngày học tiếng Anh qua báo chí hay TV cũng là một cách tốt. Cũng chính vì vậy mà mục Tiếng Anh diệu kỳ của Woo Bo Hyun tôi trên các báo thể thao được rất nhiều độc giả yêu thích, và trang cá nhân trên mạng của tôi có tới hơn một triệu lượt theo dõi. Tôi tin rằng đọc mẫu câu và thành thạo mẫu câu đó, sau đó thực hành ở nơi có càng nhiều người Mỹ bản địa càng tốt chính là cách học tiếng Anh tốt nhất.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tác giả cuốn sách này thực ra là tốt nghiệp trung học ở Hàn Quốc, sau đó hoàn thành bậc đại học và cao học ở Mỹ. Tôi từng làm người dẫn chương trình phát thanh của một đài địa phương ở Mỹ và cũng từng là giảng viên ở khoa Anh của nhiều trường đại học tại Hàn Quốc. Tôi cũng có một số hoạt động trên truyền thông như làm nhân vật chủ đề của MBC TV, KBS Radio, EBS Radio, Lady Kyung Hyang, Sports Seoul…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thông qua cuốn sách này, tôi sẽ tiếp cho các bạn dũng khí để học tiếng Anh và mở cho các bạn cánh cửa đến với thành công trong tương lai.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Tác giả Woo Bo Hyun)</strong></p>', '2014-11-14', 0, 462, 14, 24, 'NXB Đại Học Quốc Gia Hà Nội', 'null', 280, 8, 84000, 105000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/tieng-anh-ma-thuat-danh-cho-nguoi-tu-hoc_1.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Từ những nghiên cứu kỹ lưỡng trong thực tế, kết hợp tham khảo ý kiến của nhiều chuyên gia tâm lý nổi tiếng, tác giả <strong>Tanith Carey</strong> cho ra đời cuốn sách <strong>Thuần hóa cha mẹ hổ</strong> với phương pháp nuôi dạy con khoa học, phù hợp.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tanith Carey</strong> là nhà báo, nhà viết sách nổi tiếng với những giải thưởng cao quý trong ngành. Bà là người tiên phong trong việc phản đối những quan điểm sai lệch về cách giáo dục con cái của các bậc cha mẹ ngày nay. Quan điểm của bà đã được phổ biến rộng rãi trên hàng loạt tờ báo thế giới: The Guardian, The Indepent, The Indepent on Sunday, The Daily Mail Grazia Woman and Womant Own and The new York Daily new…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Thuần hóa cha mẹ hổ</strong> được đánh giá là một trong những cuốn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a> nhất về những quan điểm giáo dục sai lệch của các bậc làm cha mẹ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong phần 1 của cuốn sách, tác giả đưa ra những dẫn chứng cụ thể để chứng minh rằng vì sao “cha mẹ hổ” là trở thành xu hướng phổ biến trên toàn cầu hiện nay. Đồng thời chỉ ra rằng một trong số những nguyên nhân khiến các bậc cha mẹ có phương pháp giáo dục hà khắc với con cái là bởi sự kỳ vọng mà họ dành cho con là quá lớn, họ mong muốn con mình có thể trở thành “thần đồng” ngay khi ở trong nôi. Hoặc nguyên nhân đó còn đến từ “sự trỗi dậy của việc học phụ đạo” ở trẻ,…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mặt khác, ở chương 2 của sách, tác giả<strong> Tanith Carey</strong> chỉ ra những mối nguy hại ghê gớm của phương pháp nuôi dạy con cạnh tranh, áp lực đang ảnh hưởng đến trực tiếp đến trẻ như thế nào. Không chỉ gây ảnh hưởng đến mối quan hệ gần gũi, gắn bó giữa cha mẹ và con cái, phương pháp này còn gây ra hậu quả nghiêm trọng mà nhiều bậc cha mẹ không thể lường trước được. Hàng loạt dẫn chứng về trẻ em bị stress nặng, mắc các bệnh tâm lý như trầm cảm, tự kỷ, tự ngược đãi bản thân,… và đặc biệt tỉ lệ trẻ em tự tử đã gia tăng ở Anh. Chính những con số này là lời cảnh tỉnh cho biết bao bậc làm cha mẹ cần phải xem xét lại phương pháp giáo dục con của mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Và cuối cùng, trong chương 3 tác giả đưa ra những gợi ý cho các bậc làm cha mẹ có cái nhìn mới hơn về phương pháp giáo dục con. Dành thời gian và suy nghĩ cho con nhiều hơn, hiểu được rõ tầm quan trọng của việc chơi đùa,đừng bao giờ biến bài tập thành trận chiến, học cách nói với con, thường xuyên đưa ra những lời khen ngợi hợp lý,… Đó là cách để kết nối, thắt chặt tình cảm giữa cha mẹ và con cái dễ dàng hơn bao giờ hết. Thông điệp cuối cùng mà tác giả muốn gửi tới các bậc cha mẹ “không bao giờ là quá muộn” để học cách yêu thương và mang đến cho con những điều tuyệt vời, hạnh phúc nhất trong cuộc sống.</p>', '2015-07-14', 0, 373, 26, 15, 'NXB Dân Trí', 'null', 371, 2, 35000, 109000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bi-thuan-hoa.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Chúng ta đến với cuộc đời này bằng khí, sống bằng khí, tương tác bằng khí và ra đi cũng bằng khí. Chính vì vậy mà trong yoga và thiền học đều quan trọng khí.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu Khí quan trọng trong thực hành thì tâm lại quan trọng trong ứng dụng vào đời sống. Tất cả triết lý của các đạo giáo hay yoga, thiền học đều khẳng định với chúng ta “Hạnh phúc đến từ tâm”. Làm sao để ta chuyển hóa tâm từ tiêu cực sang tích cực, từ ác sang thiện, từ đau khổ sang hạnh phúc? Chúng ta cần phải học cách rèn tâm và hành tâm vào cuộc sống một cách đúng đắn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khí - hay còn gọi là sinh khí, năng lượng của thể vi tế, nằm ở thể thứ hai trong ba thể của con người. Nó liên quan đến những nhu cầu sống của con người.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Một khi nguồn sống này yếu đi cũng sẽ làm cho sức sống của con người bị ảnh hưởng. Nhưng nếu nguồn sinh khí này dồi dào, biểu hiện ra ngoài của cơ thể cũng trở nên sinh động, con người cũng có sức sống hơn, khỏe mạnh hơn và hạnh phúc hơn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sinh khí hay năng lượng được đưa vào cơ thể qua 5 con đường:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">1. Năng lượng mẹ truyền sang con;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">2. Năng lượng từ ăn uống;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">3. Năng lượng từ hơi thở;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">4. Năng lượng từ Yêu thương;</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">5. Năng lượng từ Vũ trụ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tâm - chữ "tâm" có rất nhiều ý nghĩa và hình thức, cho nên tâm nên là một động từ, và trong thiền đó là động từ tích cực, nó được thể hiện qua các hành động yêu thương nhất, hạnh phúc nhất thì người hành thiền mới dễ dàng đạt đến trạng thái cao trong thiền. Tâm trong Thiền Khí Tâmlà tâm hành trong đời sống.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách <strong>Thiền Khí Tâm - Nghệ Thuật Thanh Lọc Thân Tâm, Cân Bẳng Cuộc Sống</strong> có thể tiếp cận được với mọi đối tượng, dựa trên nền tảng thiền và khoa học bộ não, thể chất, năng lượng; không mang màu sắc của tôn giáo... Đây là phương pháp thiền ứng dụng để người thực hành có được một sức khỏe tốt, một tinh thần bình an và trí tuệ sáng suốt hơn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bản thân trong triết lý khoa học cổ xưa của yoga và thiền thì mỗi cá nhân là một tiểu vũ trụ, độc lập, tự do nội tâm. Vì vậy, thông qua phương pháp Thiền khí tâm, chúng ta trở thành nhà lãnh đạo của chính mình. Từ đó chúng ta phát triển được ý thức trực giác, khả năng phán đoán nhạy cảm, tăng chỉ số cảm xúc và cân bằng trong mọi  điều kiện và tình huống. Đây cũng chính là cách mà Thiền khí tâm thấm vào người tập.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách gồm hai nội dung lớn về Thiền khí tâm và Thiền cơ bản. Thiền khí tâm, được giới thiệu với phần lý thuyết và kỹ thuật thực hành dựa trên 4 cấp độ: đả thông, thanh tẩy, chuyển hóa và hợp nhất. Những bài tập Thiền khí tâm bao gồm cả Thiền tĩnh và Thiền động nên dễ dàng tiếp cận cho người mới bắt đầu.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thiền cơ bản hệ thống lại những triết lý và kỹ thuật thiền cơ bản từ nhiều ngàn năm trước của những bậc Giác ngộ và những vị Thiền sư nổi tiếng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Thiền Khí Tâm đến như món quà của Vũ trụ. Đó là lúc tôi phát hiện ra: Khi ý chí mình mạnh mẽ thì mình có thể điều khiển được tất cả mọi thứ, cho nên kỹ thuật Thiền Khí Tâm là kỹ thuật huấn luyện Ý TÓM KHÍ. Tức là sẽ luyện cho người tập có một ý chí mạnh mẽ, dẫn được khí của bản thân và dẫn dắt khí của người khác, làm cho luồng khí của mọi người hội tụ về chúng ta, và bạn chính là người vận hành dòng khí cuộc đời mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thiền Khí Tâm ra đời như một món quà tôi muốn dành cho cộng đồng và muốn lan tỏa phương pháp thanh lọc, cân bằng Thân -Tâm -Trí này cho mọi người".</p>', '2016-12-14', 0, 222, 29, 9, 'NXB Phụ Nữ', 'null', 99, 6, 64000, 80000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img139.u335.d20161220.t145258.742631.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

(103, 'Thịnh Vượng Tài Chính Tuổi 30', '<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Một trong số những mong muốn chung của mọi người là việc sống mà không cần phải lo lắng về tiền. Dù gì đi nữa nếu thiếu tiền hoặc không có tiền thì sẽ có nhiều khi phiền não, đôi khi sẽ trở nên khốn khổ. Nếu trong cuộc sống nhất thiết phải lựa chọn thời kỳ không có tiền thì nên chọn khi nào?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Dù sao thì không có tiền khi còn nhỏ là tốt nhất. Khi còn nhỏ dù mệt nhọc hay thiếu thốn thì cũng còn tốt hơn là giàu có, an nhàn khi có tuổi. Trong quá khứ dù vất vả thì hiện tại giàu có hơn, hiện tại dù có hơi vất vả thì tương lai thoải mái hơn.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"<span style="font-size: small;">Tuổi già</span>"<span style="font-size: small;"> chính là tương lai đó. Về già khi năng lực tài chính đã mất, đến tiền còn không có thì không phải là quá khốn khổ ư? Vì thế dù chỉ là một ngày thì cũng phải nhanh chóng chuẩn bị cho một tuổi già không phải lo lắng về tiền bạc.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Vậy thì cái thời gian tuổi già mà chúng ta phải chuẩn bị là bao lâu? Như ở đầu đề đã nói đến con số 30 năm có thể có cảm giác là hơi dài. Thực tế nếu bảo dự tính thời gian tuổi già cho mọi người xung quanh (từ sau khi về hưu đến lúc chết), thì đa số mọi người trả lời là 15-20 năm.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ở đất nước Hàn Quốc, thời gian tuổi già trung bình của người đi làm nam giới là khoảng 17 năm và nếu chỉ nghĩ về nam giới thì thời gian này tương đối chính xác. Nhưng mà nếu suy xét đến vấn đề vợ thường kém chồng trung bình là 3 tuổi và sống lâu hơn 7 năm thì thời gian tuổi già thực tế của 2 vợ chồng là 27 năm. Nếu kéo dài tuổi thọ theo ước tính tiêu chuẩn cuộc sống hiện tại thì cần phải chú ý là thời gian này sẽ tăng thêm từ 3 đến 5 năm.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nếu thế thời gian tuổi già là trên dưới 30 năm. Bạn có nổi da gà không khi nghe người ta nói trải qua 30 năm làm việc và 30 năm tuổi già? Nếu suy nghĩ đơn giản, trải qua tuổi già, chi tiêu theo tiêu chuẩn hiện tại thì chỉ phải tiết kiệm 1 nửa thu nhập.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: small;">Cái đó cũng ngoại trừ những khoản chi phí như mua nhà cửa, nuôi dạy con cái… và là chi phí tích lũy được khi chỉ đơn thuần nghĩ đến tuổi già. Khi đã suy nghĩ 15 năm, việc chuẩn bị cho tuổi già đã biết trước sẽ không bất ngờ tiến đến như 1 bức tường khổng lồ phải không các bạn?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Như vậy là trên thực tế phần lớn mọi người đang nghĩ đến việc bắt đầu chuẩn bị cho tuổi già từ tuổi 40. Ở trong những bài báo hoặc những cuốn sách phần lớn đều viết hẳn ra là: </span>"<span style="font-size: small;">sự chuẩn bị cho tuổi già = tuổi tứ tuần</span>"<span style="font-size: small;">. Tại sao lại như vậy? Không thể hiểu được vì sao lại thế.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Nguyên tắc cơ bản nhất của việc chuẩn bị cho tuổi già là </span>"<span style="font-size: small;">càng nhanh càng tốt</span>"<span style="font-size: small;">. Câu này được hiểu ngược lại là </span>"<span style="font-size: small;">càng muộn càng không tốt</span>"<span style="font-size: small;">. Nếu vậy thì việc công thức không được ưa chuộng được sử dụng liên tục có lẽ là do việc thỏa hiệp với độc giả. Phải đến độ tuổi 40 mọi người mới quan tâm đến hai từ </span>"<span style="font-size: small;">tuổi già</span>"<span style="font-size: small;"> vì vậy điều đó được coi là phù hợp với họ.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Trong cuốn sách này các tác giả đã quả quyết phủ nhận sự thỏa hiệp này.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Anh Kim Min Seok là nhân vật chính của cuốn sách này 35 tuổi và là trưởng phòng một doanh nghiệp lớn nhưng ở trong cuốn sách này được viết từ năm 20 tuổi đến đầu những năm 50 tuổi.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Chúng tôi mong rằng những độc giả ở tầm tuổi 20, 30 sẽ đọc và tập trung vào vấn đề </span>"<span style="font-size: small;">tại sao phải chuẩn bị cho tuổi già ngay từ bây giờ</span>"<span style="font-size: small;"> theo cách nhìn nhận của nhân vật chính. Nếu là độc giả ở tầm tuổi tứ tuần hoặc đầu ngũ tuần thì dù có hơi muộn một chút cũng hãy tập trung vào việc phải lựa chọn những phương pháp nào để bù đắp lại thời gian đã mất.</span><br /><br /> <span style="font-size: small;">Cuốn sách này không thể cho bạn mọi đáp án cho mọi vấn đề.

Có phải những người ăn chay trường, thực hành  đủ mọi loại nghi lễ Phật giáo là Phật tử? Hay những người bình thường  đang sống một cuộc đời ích lợi cho nhiều người và dù không hề biết về  Phật Pháp, họ vẫn hiểu và thực hành theo bốn sự thật trên, mới là những  người đang bước đi trên con đường Giác Ngộ với Đức Phật Thích Ca Mâu Ni.</span></p>', '2011-11-14', 0, NULL, 16, 27, 'NXB Phương Đông', 'null', 229, 5, 47000, 59000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/november_4th_010.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Những người Hy Lạp có xu hướng bẩm sinh về điều linh thiêng, họ thần thánh hóa thiên nhiên, giải thích những hiện tượng kỳ lạ bằng sự can thiệp của các vị thần, các anh hùng dũng sỹ. Nhưng thần thánh của họ sẵn sàng tham gia vào công việc trần gian, rất giống loài người: bất tử và cao đẹp nhưng họ có tất cả những ham muốn của người trần, và những anh hùng dũng sỹ dù thực hiện những cuộc phiêu lưu ở những chỗ bất thường vẫn luôn luôn là những người trần gian...</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Mời các bạn đón đọc!</span></strong></span></p>', '2012-06-14', 0, 285, 32, 29, 'NXB Văn Học', 'null', 900, 6, 164000, 205000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/than-thoai-hy-lap.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Điều này cũng đúng với liên hệ thầy và đệ tử: nếu thầy có chủ tâm đi tìm đệ tử trong khi đệ tử cũng có chủ tâm đi tìm thầy thì chắc chắn là thầy và đệ tử sẽ gặp nhau. Thầy tìm được con thì thầy nắm tay con để đi trên con đường thực tập, con trở thành thầy và thầy có trong con. Và như thế trong tay con đã có tay thầy.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bài kệ xưng tán Pháp Hoa như sau:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Đêm tụng kinh Pháp Hoa</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Tiếng xao động tinh hà</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Địa cầu vừa tỉnh giấc</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Lòng đất bỗng đơm hoa</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Đêm tụng kinh Pháp Hoa</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Bảo tháp hiện chói lòa</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Khắp trời Bồ tát hiện</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Tay Bụt trong tay ta</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tay Bụt trong tay ta có nghĩa là ta được nắm tay Bụt mà đi. Cũng có nghĩa là trong tay ta đã có tay Bụt. Bụt và ta không còn là hai thực tại riêng biệt. Ta và Bụt bất nhị. Lúc ấy thì hạnh phúc ta rất lớn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tay Thầy trong tay con</strong> - tuyển tập những lá thư thầy viết cho đệ tử. Mỗi lá thư là một chứng tích của tình Thầy, chứa đựng trọn vẹn những gì Thầy muốn trao truyền. Những lá thư ấy không bị giới hạn bởi thời gian, chúng có giá trị miên viễn. Do vậy không thể xếp theo trình tự thời gian để ta có thể đón nhận mỗi lá thư trong một hình thức rất mới, nội dung trao truyền được sống dậy trong thời khắc mà ta đang đọc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong sách chúng ta còn tiếp xúc được những th&ociocirc;ng bạch mà Thầy đã gởi đi trong những năm qua, mỗi thông bạch như những khuôn thước nền tảng thực tập. Và phần cuối là “Câu chuyện người con trai khờ dại” được Thầy viết tại Phương Bối - Bảo Lộc, Lâm Đồng năm 1961. Đọc câu chuyện để ta cảm thêm sự rộng lớn của tình Thầy qua những lá thư. Chúng ta thấy người con trai trong câu chuyện là một người rất thật, và cho đến nay chưa một lần từ chối làm người “khờ dại” cho tình thương.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chúng ta cùng đón nhận “mối tình” rất đẹp này và giữ riêng cho mình những gì rất gần, để cùng hiểu, cùng thương và cùng hiến tặng.</p>', '2015-10-14', 0, NULL, 16, 11, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 247, 6, 52000, 65000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bia_tay_thay_trong_tay_con_out-02.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Khi một nhóm người cùng cười vì điều gì đó, theo bản năng họ sẽ nhìn về phía những người họ cảm thấy thân thiết nhất (hoặc muốn cảm thấy thân thiết nhất)<br /><br />2. Nhai kẹo cao su hoặc ăn gì đó khi bạn đang cảm thấy lo lắng. Đây là mẹo đánh lừa phần nguyên thủy trong não bộ, rằng nếu đang được ăn thì bạn không gặp nguy hiểm gì cả.<br /><br /><span class="text_exposed_show">3. Nếu ai đó tức giận với bạn và bạn giữ bình tĩnh, họ có thể sẽ giận dữ hơn, nhưng sau đó họ sẽ tự cảm thấy xấu hổ.<br /><br />4. Nếu bạn hỏi ai đó một câu hỏi và họ chỉ trả lời một phần, hãy tiếp tục nhìn thẳng vào mắt họ và im lặng. Người trả lời sẽ biết rằng câu trả lời đầu tiên chưa đầy đủ, và tự động nói tiếp.<br /><br />5. Thể hiện cảm xúc là một trong những cách tạo nên cảm xúc, nên nếu bạn muốn cảm thấy hạnh phúc, hãy cười hết cỡ.<br /><br />6. Đừng nói hay viết “Tôi tin” hay “Tôi nghĩ”. Nó rất chung chung, vả lại còn nghe giống như bạn đang thiếu tự tin.<br /><br />7. Trước buổi phỏng vấn, tưởng tượng bạn là bạn cũ của người phỏng vấn. Bạn chịu trách nhiệm về cách bạn cảm nhận và đối mặt với mọi tình huống, và sự thoải mái của bạn sẽ lây lan.<br /><br />8. Nếu bạn tỏ ra vui vẻ và hào hứng khi gặp mọi người, lần tới gặp lại, họ thậm chí sẽ vui vẻ và hào hứng hơn với bạn. (Những chú chó dùng mẹo này với chúng ta suốt đó )<br /><br />9. Người ta nhiều khả năng sẽ bị thuyết phục với những đề nghị nhỏ hơn nếu trước đó họ đã từ chối những đề nghị lớn.<br /><br />10. Rất nhiều phản ứng vật lý của căng thẳng tương tự với vui vẻ (thở dốc, tim đập nhanh, v.v..). Nếu bạn có thể xoay chuyển tình thế, căng thẳng sẽ trở thành vui vẻ.<br /><br />11. Hầu hết mọi người không phân biệt được sự khác nhau giữa tỏa sáng và tự tin. Nếu bạn tỏ ra hiểu rõ điều mình đang làm, mọi người sẽ tập trung lại quanh bạn.<br /><br />12. Nếu bạn làm công việc chăm sóc khách hàng, hãy đặt một tấm gương đằng sau lưng. Khách hàng hàng sẽ trở nên dễ thương hơn vì không ai muốn nhìn thấy bản thân mình cư xử thô lỗ.<br /><br />13. Nếu bạn đang ở trong một cuộc họp nhóm và chờ đợi ai đó giao nhiệm vụ cho mình, hãy ngồi ngay bên cạnh họ. Họ sẽ gỡ bỏ hàng rào phòng vệ và cảm giác muốn tấn công bạn để cảm thấy an toàn. Ít nhất, nó cũng làm dịu bớt sự ích kỷ trong họ.<br /><br />14. Trong buổi hẹn đầu tiên, hãy đưa người bạn đang để ý tới những nơi phấn khích. Họ sẽ có liên kết cảm xúc với bạn nhiều hơn với những cảm giác kịch tính.<br /><br />15. Hãy chú ý tới màu mắt của người khác khi bạn gặp họ. Người ta sẽ thích bạn hơn khi bạn tăng việc giao tiếp bằng mắt.</span></p>', '2016-11-14', 0, 294, 35, 15, 'NXB Dân Trí', 'null', 292, 2, 87000, 109000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/14910283_1159899424101098_4845023529787863520_n.u547.d20161115.t093606.760219.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Sử dụng các phương pháp khoa học điều tra các chủ đề khác thường thu hút sự quan tâm của công chúng cũng như cộng đồng khoa học, <strong><em>Tâm lý học hài hước</em></strong> mang đến hiểu biết mới cho những phần chưa được khám phá của tâm trí con người và đưa chúng ta đến những nơi các nhà khoa học chính thống sợ bước đến.

Các nghiên cứu chỉ ra rằng, đàn ông thường cười trước những câu chuyện có những phụ nữ ngớ ngẩn và phụ nữ thích những câu chuyện cười có những gã đàn ông ngu ngốc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Liệu có thật có người sinh ra đã may mắn, và nhiều người thì “xui tận mạng” suốt cuộc đời không? Liệu mọi người có thể thay đổi vận may của mình không? Các nghiên cứu cho thấy, bạn có thể thay đổi vận may của mình.

Nhưng làm thế nào để có thể đi? Nếu bạn đang tự hỏi câu đó, thì tôi có tin mừng cho bạn: du lịch bụi không phải là chế tạo tên lửa. Nó dễ thôi, và không tốn nhiều tiền như ta tưởng.”</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rosie Nguyễn</strong> đã mở đầu cuốn sách nhỏ này một cách thẳng thắn, mộc mạc và hài hước như thế. Đó cũng là cách mà cô “dẫn dắt” người đọc trong suốt hành trình <strong>Ta ba lô trên đất Á</strong> - cuốn sách đầu tiên của một tác giả Việt hướng dẫn chi tiết về việc đi du lịch.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Một vài năm trở lại đây, sách viết về đề tài du lịch ngày càng nhận được nhiều sự quan tâm của độc giả trẻ. Tuy nhiên, có nhiều ý kiến cho rằng: sách du ký truyền cho người trẻ cảm hứng sống và xê dịch, nhưng không trực tiếp đến mức khuyến khích hay trở thành động lực để độc giả đọc xong là có thể “xách ba lô và lên đường”. Lý do là bởi những cuốn sách du ký thường tập trung vào việc kể lại những trải nghiệm, suy nghĩ của tác giả nhưng lại thiếu đi rất nhiều thông tin cần thiết, cụ thể để độc giả có thể tự thực hiện được một hành trình của riêng mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhưng rõ ràng, “du lịch bụi” không nên chỉ là một cụm từ hay một ý niệm để người trẻ đôi khi mơ màng nghĩ tới rồi chậc lưỡi. Du lịch bụi nên là một kế hoạch cụ thể. Và <strong>Ta ba lô trên đất Á</strong> ra đời để giúp bạn hiện thực kế hoạch đó.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách được chia làm nhiều chương. Chương đầu tiên dẫn người đọc đến với thế giới phượt: thế nào là phượt, phượt thì cần những gì, phượt để làm gì? Chương thứ hai là những hướng dẫn quan trọng và thực tế để phượt, từ việc tìm thông tin ở đâu, nên lựa chọn điểm đến và hành trình như thế nào, cho đến những điều nên chú ý khi đi phượt, thậm chí còn bao gồm cả một danh sách mẫu những đồ dùng cần mang theo khi phượt. Các chương tiếp theo đầy ắp kiến thức về văn hóa, lịch sử, địa lý, con người ở các quốc gia, những kinh nghiệm du lịch cụ thể, những câu chuyện, trải nghiệm thú vị, chân thực và đầy cảm xúc trên từng cung đường tác giả đã đi qua. Tất cả được viết với một văn phong giản dị, gần gũi nhưng không kém phần sâu sắc và dí dỏm. Một trong những điểm đặc biệt khác cần ghi nhận ở cuốn sách này, đó là góc nhìn rất thực tế và khách quan của tác giả. Là một phượt thủ, một kẻ yêu xê dịch, sống để được đi, nhưng<strong> Rosie Nguyễn</strong> không hề cực đoạn khi nói về phượt, không cường điệu, không tô vẽ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Như một người bạn chân thành, hòa nhã và hiểu biết,<strong> Ta ba lô trên đất Á</strong> giúp bạn mở cánh cửa để có một cái nhìn thực tế và rõ nét về phượt, để bạn biết được nên bắt đầu từ đâu và như thế nào, khi bạn đã sẵn sàng rồi, lựa chọn có “xách ba lô lên và đi” hay không là của bạn. Có thể bạn là một người trẻ, khao khát mơ về chuyến đi đầu tiên của mình nhưng không biết làm cách nào để bắt đầu? Hoặc bạn là một người đã đi nhiều nơi, nhưng chỉ đi theo tour và đang tìm hiểu về du lịch bụi? Hay bạn là một phượt tử đã đi được kha khá nơi, nhưng vẫn muốn biết xem quyển sách này có gì hay ho mới mẻ? Nếu vậy, thì đây là quyển sách dành cho bạn.</p>', '2015-04-14', 0, 347, 36, 12, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 336, 3, 78000, 97000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/taba-lo.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Tất nhiên virus không tự sinh ra.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Có thể việc viết virus mang mục đích phá hoại, thử nghiệm hay đơn giản chỉ là một thú đùa vui ác ý.

Theo đề nghị của bạn đọc từ nhiều năm nay muốn có và được lưu giữ một cuốn sổ vừa ghi chép, vừa là một người bạn tinh thần chia sẻ, động viên và truyền cảm hứng vào những thời điểm khó khăn của cuộc sống, nhân kỷ niệm 20 năm thành lập, First News đã thiết kế và ra mắt ấn bản đặc biệt Aniversary Special Edition song ngữ Anh - Việt mang tên Sổ Tay Truyền Cảm Hứng - Hạt Giống Tâm Hồn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sổ được thiết kế đơn giản nhưng trang nhã, chất giấy mịn, có dòng kẻ, màu giấy tươi sáng. Những câu nói hay, ý nghĩa của những người thông thái, nổi tiếng trên thế giới, hình ảnh tác giả được trình bày xen kẽ với những câu chuyện “Súp Gà Cho Tâm Hồn” ý nghĩa và lịch ghi chép 2015. Câu danh ngôn được trích dẫn nguyên bản và chụp lại trên những bức tường đường phố, trên ghế đá công viên, trên thành xe buýt, trên vách đá ở khắp nơi trên thế giới… hay được viết, khắc nguệch ngoạc không biết từ bao giờ bởi những người vô danh nhưng có thể làm lay động lòng người.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi bạn gặp một biến cố hay nỗi đau buồn, bạn không thể không mỉm cười và có góc nhìn lạc quan hơn khi đọc câu nói dí dỏm và “thấm đời” của danh hài Charlie Chaplin: “Tôi có rất nhiều vấn đề và nỗi buồn trong cuộc đời, nhưng đôi môi của tôi không hề biết. Chúng luôn cười”. Hay câu nói lừng danh của của nhà triết học, nhà thơ Oscar Wilde từ thế kỷ thứ 18: “Đừng khóc cho những gì đã mất. Hãy cười vì những gì còn lại”. “Khi cuộc đời cho bạn hàng trăm lý do để khóc, hãy tìm từ cuộc sống hàng nghìn lý do để cười”.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hay vào những lúc cân nhắc, suy tư, chiêm nghiệm sự được mất, bại thành, hay quyết định làm một điều gì đó, bạn sẽ tìm thấy sự chia sẻ sâu sắc của George Horace Lorimer: “Có tiền và những thứ mua được bằng tiền là điều rất tốt, nhưng thỉnh thoảng bạn hãy kiểm tra lại xem bạn có mất đi những thứ mà tiền không thể mua được không”. Và câu chia sẻ chân tình của Steve Jobs: “Làm người giàu có nhất trong nghĩa trang chẳng có nghĩa lý gì, chết chẳng ai mang theo được gì hết - nên hãy sống rộng mở”. Bạn cũng sẽ hiểu quan điểm sống thú vị của bà Michelle <a href="https://tiki.vn/lanh-dao-phong-cach-barack-obama-p215901.html">Obama</a>, phu nhân đương kim Tổng thống Hoa Kỳ Barack Obama: “Thành công không phải là bạn kiếm được bao nhiêu tiền - mà là sự khác biệt bạn tạo nên cho cuộc sống của những người khác” hay cha đẻ của thuyết tương đối Albert Einstein:“Đừng cố gắng trở thành một người thành công, mà tốt hơn, hãy cố gắng trở thành  một người có giá trị". Bạn sẽ gặp lại tác giả phiêu bạt lừng danh Jack London về sự khắc nghiệt của cuộc sống qua tác phẩm nổi tiếng “Tiếng gọi nơi hoang dã” và “<a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">T&igrigrave;nh yêu</a> Cuộc sống” với câu nói trực diện, thẳng thắn khiến bạn không thể không giật mình, suy ngẫm: “Cho con chó một cục xương thì không phải là từ thiện. Từ thiện là một cục xương chia sẻ với con chó khi bạn cũng đang đói như một con chó”.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong một thế giới đầy biến động và thay trắng đổi đen từng ngày như hiện nay, bạn sẽ rất tâm đắc với câu nói của nhà bác học Albert Einstein: “Thế giới sẽ không bị hủy hoại bởi những kẻ làm điều ác, mà sẽ bị tàn phá bởi những kẻ thấy điều ác đó mà dửng dưng không làm gì cả". Bạn cũng sẽ tìm ra giải pháp trong những trường hợp lựa chọn tình yêu thương của cuộc sống với câu nói của người dành cả cuộc đời đấu tranh chống chủ nghĩa phân biệt chủng tộc Martin Luther King: “Bóng tối không thể đẩy lùi được bóng tối; Chỉ có ánh sáng mới có thể. Lòng thù hận không thể hóa giải được thù hận; Chỉ có tình yêu thương mới hóa giải được”. Hay câu nói bất hủ của Mẹ Teresa: “Ngay cả những người giàu có cũng đói khát tình yêu thương, họ cũng mong muốn được chăm sóc, mong muốn được tìm kiếm, và mong muốn có được ai đó của riêng mình”.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu bạn đang là người cầm bút, kiên định với cách sống của mình và có những lúc lung lay niềm tin, tinh thần bạn sẽ rộng mở, mạnh mẽ hơn khi đọc được câu thú vị của Harley Davidson: “Khi viết câu chuyện của cuộc đời bạn, đừng để ai giữ ngòi bút”, hay câu nói thể hiện cá tính khác biệt của Lý Tiểu Long; “Tôi không bước vào thế giới này để sống theo kỳ vọng của các bạn, và bạn cũng không bước vào thế giới này để sống theo kỳ vọng của tôi”, hay nhận định của nhà triết học Milton Friedman: “Ai đi nhanh nhất - người đó sẽ đi một mình trong cô đơn”.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ai đó đang đối diện với những khó khăn, thử thách, nghịch cảnh sẽ tâm đắc với câu nói nổi tiếng của Helen Keller: “Cuộc sống là chấp nhận mạo hiểm hoặc là không có gì hết”, hay câu nói của Che Guevara, nhà cách mạng lỗi lạc người Achentina: “Nếu bạn tìm ra con đường mà không hề có trở ngại nào hết, thì nó sẽ chẳng dẫn bạn đi tới đâu” hoặc tâm sự của Nelson Meldela: “Người dũng cảm không phải không cảm nhận sự sợ hãi - nhưng biết chế ngự và vượt qua nó.” hoặc câu nói của Barack Obama: “Chúng ta đến với thế giới này không phải để sợ hãi về tương lai. Chúng ta tới đây để sắp xếp nó lại”, Hay triết lý sống của Bruce Lee - Lý Tiểu Long: “Nếu bạn luôn đặt giới hạn cho mọi thứ bạn làm, từ thể chất cho đến bất kỳ điều gì khác, nó sẽ lây nhiễm vào công việc và cuộc sống của bạn. Không hề có giới hạn nào hết. Có chăng chỉ là những mức độ đạt được, và bạn không được chễm chệ ở đó mãi. Bạn phải vượt lên chúng”, hẳn bạn sẽ được tiếp thêm động lực và sức mạnh tinh thần.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Điều thú vị là các danh ngôn, câu nói được áp dụng thủ pháp chơi chữ, ngắn gọn và rất giản dị, tạo sự khám phá bất ngờ cho người đọc, dễ nhớ và gần gũi, chẳng hạn như:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Mục đích cuộc sống là sống có mục đích - Purpose of life is a life of purpose - Robert Byrne”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Tính cách có thể mở được cánh cửa, nhưng chỉ có nhân cách mới mở rộng được cánh cửa dài lâu - Personlality can open the doors, but the Character can keep them open - Elmer G. Letterman”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Ý nghĩa cuộc sống là đi tìm món quà cho bạn. Mục đích của cuộc sống là trao tặng món quà nó đi”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Có một triệu người bạn chưa phải là một điều diệu kỳ. Điều diệu kỳ chính là có một người bạn luôn ở bên bạn khi có hàng triệu người chống lại bạn”; “Khi thực hành sự tha thứ, kẻ thù của người đó chính là người thầy tốt nhất” - Dalai Lama..</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Và hàng trăm câu danh ngôn thú vị, độc đáo khác của những người nổi tiếng cùng những câu chuyện Hạt Giống Tâm Hồn hay nhất được chọn lọc trong cuốn sổ này sẽ đưa bạn đến một thế giới rộng mở với những chân lý, giá trị vĩnh hằng mà bạn đã từng được biết, được nghe đến đâu đó vào những giai đoạn hạnh phúc, bình yên nhất của cuộc sống; Hy vọng đây sẽ là điểm tựa tinh thần cho bạn ở hiện tại và tương lai.</p>', '2015-01-14', 0, NULL, 1, 20, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', 238, 3, 80000, 100000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/001.u2377.d20160714.t143629.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Bằng phẫu thuật nội soi, các phẫu thuật viên đã cắt bỏ túi mật, ruột thừa, u nang buồng trứng, cắt u đại tràng nối tận - tận hoặc làm hậu môn nhân tạo thay động mạch chủ bằng ống ghép mạch máu nhân tạo.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong phẫu thuật lồng ngực, con người đã thực hiện thành công phẫu thuật nối động mạh chủ - vành, không sử dụng máy tim phổi nhân tạo; thắt ống động mạch trong bệnh tim bẩm sinh hở ống Botal; sinh thiết hạch trung thất; sinh thiết u phổi; cắt hạch giao cảm trong lồng ngực để điều trị chứng đổ mồ hôi tay. Trong phẫu thuật nội soi vùng cổ, người ta cắt bỏ bướu giáp nhân, hạch cổ... Dùng các phương pháp can thiệp không xâm lấn, các bác sĩ nội ngoại khoa tim mạch đã thành công trong việc tách van hai lá bị hẹp bằng cây dù Inoue, nong động mạnh vành bị hẹp và đặt Stent...</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tuy nhiên, không phải ở đâu cũng thực hiện đươc các kỹ thuật mới này, vì nó còn phụ thuộc vào trang thiết bị chuyên khoa, tay nghề và kinh nghiệm của bác sĩ kỹ thuật viên. Thêm vào đó, không phải trường hợp nào cũng có chỉ định phẫu thuật nội soi hay can thiệp không xâm lấn, thậm chí còn là chống chỉ định; và các biến chứng cũng có khi rất nặng nề nếu bác sĩ chưa nhuần nhuyễn kỹ thuật mổ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mặc dù trong ngành phẫu thuật có nhiều tiến bộ như đã kể trên, rất nhiều phương pháp phẫu thuật cổ điển cho đến nay vẫn còn giữ nguyên giá trị của nó và vẫn được áp dụng rộng rãi bên cạnh các phương pháp phẫu thuật mới trong các cơ sở phẫu thuật hiện đại. Bên cạnh đó, người thầy thuốc ngoại khoa không chỉ làm việc bằng đôi bàn tay khéo léo của mình như từ xưa nhiều người vẫn quan niệm, mà còn bằng khối óc thông minh, sự nhanh nhẹn, tháo vát, để giải quyết nhiều tình huống phức tạp xảy ra ngay trên bàn mổ khi chẩn đoán lâm sàng không phù hợp với chuẩn đoán phẫu thuật. Đôi khi chỉ một sai sót nhỏ của phẫu thuật viên cũng đủ để lại hậu quả nghiêm trọng hay làm ảnh hưởng đến tính mạng người bệnh.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trước khi tiến hành một cuộc mổ phức tạp cho người bệnh, các phẫu thuật viên, nhất là phẫu thuật viên trẻ phải ôn lại giải phẫu của cơ quan bộ phận sắp được can thiệp phẫu thuật, lựa chọn phương pháp mổ thích hợp và tối ưu, dự kiến trước tình huống khó khăn có thể xảy ra trong khi mổ để có biện pháp đối phó và phòng tránh các biến chứng trong và sau mổ.

Bạn là người ưa khám phá…? Và trong mỗi chuyến đi, bạn đã biết chuẩn bị cho mình hành trang cần thiết?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách <strong>Sổ tay du lịch Campuchia </strong>sẽ mang đến cho bạn những thông tin bổ ích và vô cùng bất ngờ về một chuyến đi chơi đến đất nước Campuchia xinh đẹp. Đất nước có thủ đô Phnom Penh  với kiến trúc hiện đại đầu thế kỉ 20, âm hưởng rõ rệt của lịch sử nửa cuối thế kỉ 20 và các nhà hàng, quán bar thú vị. Khỏi phải bàn thêm về sự hấp dẫn của Angkor song bạn cũng nên đến những nơi khác ngoài Angkor Wat và Bayon. Các đền chùa  hẻo lánh, như Banteay Srei và Rolous Group khá dễ đi hay những khu đền ít nổi tiếng hơn (như Sambor Prei Kuk và Banteay Chhmar) cũng rất đáng đưa vào lịch trình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Một cách khác để đi từ Phnom Penh đến Siem Reap là men theo con đường dọc phía tây Biển Hồ Tonlé Sap, nghỉ chân ở những địa danh mới nổi vô cùng duyên dáng trên đường như Kompong Chhnang và Battambang. Bờ biển Campuchia cũng rất tuyệt và Sihanouville, với những bãi biển cát trắng trải dài được kỳ vọng trở thành khu tập trung resort của quốc gia, song đang sa vào hàng loạt dự án phát triển không bền vững phá hoại cả bờ biển và đại dương.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cảnh quan trên đường đi  từ Kampot  đến Kep ( đi qua công viên quốc gia Núi Bokor) hay giữa Sihanoukville và Koh Kong rất nổi bật. Kratie, trong các tỉnh nẳm bên bờ sông Mekong ở vùng đông bắc, là một thị trấn đồng quê bên sông, ở đó người ta có thể nghỉ ngơi bên nước triều xuống chậm  của sông Mekong và thoáng thấy bóng dáng những chú cá heo Irrawaddy hiếm hoi. Khung cảnh nơi đây thực sự khiến du khách phải sửng sốt, thêm vào đó hoàng hôn rực đỏ ở thị trấn này thật sự là điểm nhấn của tất cả những chuyến đi tới đây. Mặc dù đường đến địa danh này khá khó đi, hầu hết các vị khách đều ca ngợi vẻ đẹp thôn quê bình dị của vùng đông bắc Campuchia, đặc biệt là Ratanakiri với những quả đồi, cây cối và những bộ tộc thiểu số. Địa danh vùng sâu vùng xa cảnh trí đa dạng này rất hấp dẫn những du khách độc lập và quả quyết.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ngoài ra, những vùng còn lại của Campuchia, mặc dù thấm đẫm phong cách và sự quyến rũ đặc trưng Khmer, không có nhiều khác biệt để được xem là điểm đến chính. Với phần lớn khách du lịch, sự thanh bình và, nói không ngoa, nhịp điệu cuộc sống như vô tận của Campuchia chính là điểm lôi cuốn nhất - và để thực sự cảm nhận được nét đẹp này cần có một lịch trình thong thả.</p>', '2014-07-14', 0, 15, 16, 36, 'NXB Lao Động Xã Hội', 'null', NULL, 7, 79000, 99000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/so-tay-du-lich-campuchia.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Với cuốn sách này, người đọc sẽ đi từ sự sụp đổ của nền văn minh Maya, đến với sự bùng nổ và suy tàn của người Viking, xem xét sự hưng thịnh và kết cục bi thảm của người Norse ở Greenland…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Những nguyên nhân nào được xem là căn bản nhất cho mọi sự diễn tiến hay suy bại của các xã hội trên toàn thế giới? Có thể kiếm tìm một lý giải hay một mô hình cho tất cả những thất bại và thành công của nhân loại hay không? Chúng ta có thể học gì từ sự thất bại của những nền văn minh từng là vĩ đại nhất?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhân loại sẽ cần ghi nhớ những điều được <strong>Jared Diamond</strong> tổng kết:<em> “Chúng ta đang tiến rất nhanh trên con đường không bền vững… nên bằng cách này hay cách khác, các vấn đề môi trường của thế giới sẽ được các thế hệ trẻ hiện nay giải quyết. Vấn đề ở đây là liệu chúng có được giải quyết bằng những cách thích hợp do chính chúng ta chọn lựa hay không, hay bằng những cách tiêu cực mà chúng ta không muốn chọn lựa như chiến tranh, diệt chủng, dịch bệnh và các xã hội sụp đổ. Trong khi tất cả các hiện tượng tàn khốc trên luôn gắn chặt với lịch sử xã hội loài người, nhưng mức độ nghiêm trọng của suy thoái môi trường và áp lực dân số sẽ kéo theo đói nghèo và bất ổn chính trị." </em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhận xét về cuốn sách, Tim Falannery cho rằng: Cuốn sách Sụp đổ n&agraveagrave;y cần phải được đọc nghiêm túc. Đây chắc chắn là cuốn sách quan trọng nhất bạn từng đọc. Trong khi đó, diễn giả số 1 thế giới, Malcolm Gladwell, nhận xét: <em>"Bài học của Sụp đổ là, các xã hội vốn không bị giết chết.

Với lợi thế của BIM, Revit Structure giúp cải thiện sự phối hợp giữa các ngành, các lĩnh vực, giảm thiểu các lỗi và tăng cường sự hợp tác giữa các kỹ sư kết cấu và nhóm thành viên trong dự án như: kiến trúc sư (thông qua phần mềm Revit Architecture), kỹ sư thiết kế hệ thống cung cấp điện, nước (thông qua phần mềm Revit MEP), và chủ đầu tư.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Autodesk Robot Structural Analaysis Professional là phần mềm dành cho các kỹ sư, đặc biệt là kỹ sư kết cấu. Nó có khả năng mô phỏng xây dựng, phân tích các kết cấu lớn và phức tạp. Các phần mềm phân tích, tính toán kết cấu cung cấp một quy trình làm việc xuyên suốt và khả năng tương tác với phần mềm Autodesk Revit Structure để mở rộng quá trình xây dựng mô hình thông tin xây dựng gọi tắt là BIM. Cho phép các kỹ sư kết cấu nhanh chóng thực hiện việc mô phỏng và phân tích toàn diện nhiều loại kết cấu.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">AutoCAD Structural Detailing (ASD) là phần mềm hỗ trợ vẽ các chi tiết của kết cấu xây dựng cả bê tông cốt thép và kết cấu thép đi kèm với Robot thành một gói phần mềm hoàn chỉnh cho kỹ sư kết cấu.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">ASD là chương trình được sử dụng để chuẩn bị cho việc thiết kế các bản vẽ chi tiết kết cấu sau khi hoàn thành xong giai đoạn thiết kế cấu tạo kiến trúc. Chương trình còn cho phép tạo ra một mô hình tính toán kết cấu bao gồm việc tính toán và xác minh các yếu tố về kết cấu, chuẩn bị các tài liệu kỹ thuật cho dự án và đưa ra các bản vẽ cuối cùng thỏa mãn yêu cầu của người sử dụng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nội dung sách bao gồm 9 chương.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 1: Làm quen với Revit Structure:</strong> Giúp bạn làm quen với giao diện làm việc của chương trình Revit Structure qua bài tập thiết kế 1 mô hình nhà với 1 khung gồm: móng, cột, dầm và sàn theo mô hình và mặt bằng tầng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 2: Mối quan hệ giữa Revit Structure và Autocad:</strong> Hướng dẫn bạn các tạo mô hình như hình bên từ file AutoCAD có sẵn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 3: Sử dụng công cụ extension:</strong> Extensions là các tiện ích mở rộng của Revit giúp người dùng có thể thực hiện một số thao tác nhanh hơn so với các cách làm thông thường.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 4: Thiết kế cốt thép cho kết cấu bê tông cốt thép:</strong> Hướng dẫn cách ứng dụng Extensions để thiết kết cốt thép cho kết cấu bê tông cốt thép. Các bạn sẽ thiết kế nhanh cốt thép cho cả công trình giúp tiết kiệm được rất nhiều thời gian, công sức cùng các thao thác thực hiện phức tạp trước đây.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 5: Dựng mô hình và thiết kế cốt thép cho kết cấu với extension:</strong> Bài tập này kết hợp việc dựng mô hình và bố trí cốt thép ngay trên mô hình kết cấu bê tông cốt thép.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 6: Làm quen với Autocad Structural Detailing 2013:</strong> Cho phép tạo các tài liệu hướng dẫn chi tiết đầy đủ về kết cấu (các bản vẽ và thống kê vật liệu), quá trình tạo ra các bản vẽ với AutoCAD Detailing là tự động. Chương trình thiết kế các bản vẽ chi tiết kết cấu sau khi hoàn thành xong giai đoạn thiết kế cấu tạo kiến trúc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 7: Mối quan hệ giữa Revit Structural và Autocad Structural Detailing:</strong> Thực hành thiết kế cốt thép cho một kết cấu bê tông cốt thép với mô hình, ta có thể thực hiện với AutoCAD trên bản vẽ 2D hoặc có thể triển khai bản vẽ chi tiết các cấu kiện cột, dầm, sàn với AutoCAD Structural Detailing sau đó xuất ra bảng thống kê.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 8: Lập bảng thống kê (dự toán) với Revit Structure:</strong> Sau khi thiết kế xong phần kết cấu của công trình, người thiết kế có thể thực hiện việc thống kê khối lượng bê tông, cốt thép cho công trình với Revit Structure sau đó chuyển sang Microsoft Office Excel để thực hiện các thao tác khác một cách nhanh chóng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chương 9: Xuất và in bản vẽ:</strong> Hướng dẫn xuất và in bản vẽ từ mô hình đã dựng.</p>', '2013-06-14', 0, 199, 13, 10, 'NXB Từ Điển Bách Khoa', 'null', 326, 2, 64000, 80000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img652.u2469.d20160604.t104443.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Những người khác thì coi đây là một sự khó hiểu. Nhưng số lượng các startup công nghệ từ Israel là rất đáng kinh ngạc.<br /></strong></p>  <div>Một quốc gia nhỏ chỉ có khoảng 7,6 triệu người nhưng có đến 4.800 startup và thu hút số lượng vốn đầu tư mạo hiểm trên mỗi đầu người nhiều nhất thế giới. Được gọi là Quốc gia khởi nghiệp, Israel vượt qua cả Mỹ về số vốn đầu tư mạo hiểm mỗi người, với 170 USD, so với 70 USD của Mỹ. Đây là một con số không tồi chút nào cho 1 quốc gia mới thành lập 65 năm trước.</div>  <div>Có thể kể đến một vài startup nổi tiếng từ Insrael như Waze - công ty bản đồ vừa được Google mua lại, iOnRoad - ứng dụng di động cảnh báo tài xế khi họ đến quá gần chiếc xe khác ở trước mặt, hay Conduit - thanh toolbar cộng đồng được toàn thế giới chú ý.</div>  <div>Israel cũng là nơi sản sinh ra những công ty sáng tạo và đổi mới nổi tiếng như Teva - công ty sản xuất thuốc với giá trị thị trường là 43 tỷ USD và Check Point - công ty công nghệ phần mềm có trị giá 11 tỷ USD.</div>  <div>Vậy điều gì khiến Israel trở thành cái nôi "nuôi dưỡng" sự sáng tạo, đổi mới và phong trào khởi nghiệp như vậy? Uriel Peled - đồng sáng lập của startup chuyên tạo các mã QR Visualead của Israel - đã cho chúng ta biết lý do.</div>  <div><strong>Quân đội</strong></div>  <div>Ở Israel, hầu hết mọi người dân đều gia nhập quân đội trước khi vào đại học. Trong quân đội, rất nhiều người trở thành chuyên gia về công nghệ, bởi công nghệ là một yếu tố chủ chốt trong việc giao tiếp và hoạt động ở đây. Môi trường và văn hóa trong quân đội của Israel cũng rất khuyến khích khởi nghiệp và sự lãnh đạo. Sau khi rời quân đội, rất nhiều các người lính trẻ nhận ra rằng họ muốn tạo nên 1 công ty có thể giải quyết các vấn đề trên thế giới qua giải pháp công nghệ. Họ chỉ cần chọn vấn đề nào họ muốn giải quyết.</div>  <div><strong>Trường đại học</strong></div>  <div>Bên cạnh sự hỗ trợ từ chính phủ, Israel còn có những trường đại học xuất sắc nhất thế giới về công nghệ, như Technion tại haifa. Những trường đại học ở đây như là một sân chơi cho các nhà khởi nghiệp để gặp gỡ những người có cùng chung sở thích và có thể khởi nghiệp cùng nhau sau này.</div>  <div><strong>Tài nguyên từ chính phủ</strong></div>  <div>Chính phủ Israel rất khuyến khích các nhà khởi nghiệp trẻ mạo hiểm thành lập công ty bằng cách hỗ trợ vốn cho họ. Chính phủ nước này cũng giúp họ trong cả việc giới thiệu các startup đến với nhà đầu tư, tạo nên những quan hệ đối tác và những chương trình hỗ trợ cho các công ty mới.</div>  <div><strong>Người hướng dẫn</strong></div>  <div>Thế hệ khởi nghiệp đầu tiên của Israel giờ đây đang trong giai đoạn "nghỉ hưu", và họ là nguồn hỗ trợ cả về tài chính và kiến thức cho thế hệ tiếp theo. Họ cũng đóng vai trò là những nhà đầu tư cho các startup mới, cũng như tư vấn cho các startup về cách phát triển mô hình kinh doanh và xâm chiếm thị trường.</div>  <div>Tuy vậy, 1 trong những điểm mạnh và cũng là điểm yếu của các startup Israel là họ thường phát triển công ty với một kế hoạch rời khỏi thị trường sau khi tạo được đột phá, chứ không bao giờ phát triển công ty thành 1 tập đoàn lớn. Mọi người Israel đều muốn trở thành ông chủ.

Với phiên bản CS6, Adobe đã trang bị cho người dùng cỗ máy "Adobe Mercury Graphics Engine” cải thiện đáng kể tốc độ xử lý các tác vụ và gia tăng khả năng tải ảnh "bốc lửa" vốn có của Photoshop.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phiên bản CS6 hướng tới những người dùng nghiệp dư, thậm chí là những người chưa từng sử dụng các phần mềm đồ họa. Photoshop CS6 tối giản các tác vụ, giúp cho các phép hiệu chỉnh đơn giản hơn, dễ sử dụng hơn và công cụ trở nên dễ hiểu để sử dụng hơn. Điều này giúp cho mọi người hứng thú hơn với công việc chỉnh sửa ngay cả những người dùng không chuyên. Photoshop CS6 cập nhật nhiều tính năng hoàn toàn mới và cải tiến hơn hẳn so với phiên bản cũ trước đây. Có tổng cộng 22 cập nhật mới, trong 15 nhóm trong đó có 5 nhóm quan trọng đối với nhiếp ảnh. Bao gồm:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Crop Tool: Được cải tiến giúp người sử dụng xem trước tương tác, qua đó có thể hình dung tốt hơn kết quả mình nhận được. Dễ dàng chọn vùng và điều chỉnh kích thước, biên độ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Blur Gallery: Cung cấp 3 lựa chọn Field Blur/ Iris Blur/ Tilt Shift trong đó chọn Iris blur sẽ xuất hiện hình oval trên bức ảnh cho phép người dùng chọn vùng ảnh muốn được làm rõ nét nhất. Vùng nằm ngoài hình oval sẽ mờ dần đi và người dùng có thể quy định ảnh bắt đầu mờ dần từ vị trí nào cũng như điều chỉnh độ mờ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Adaptive Wide Angle: Cho phép uốn cong hình ảnh theo góc độ mong muốn tạo ra những bức ảnh đầy nghệ thuật.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Video Demo: Được thiết kế theo phong cách timeline clip với nhiều hiệu ứng động và chèn âm thanh giúp người dùng tạo ra được các video chuyên nghiệp nhanh chóng và dễ dàng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Content Aware Patch: Cho phép người dùng lấp đi những chi tiết không mong muốn hoặc đắp lỗ thủng trên bức hình do cắt hoặc xóa bằng cách sao chép những họa tiết của vùng gần đó thế vào.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Content Ware Move: Giúp người sử dụng di chuyển một đối tượng đã chọn trong ảnh sang vị trí khác một cách dễ dàng, nhanh chóng chỉ với thao tác chọn vùng và kéo thả mà không để lại dấu vết nào và không cần các thao tác phân lớp phức tạp.<br />- <a href="http://tiki.vn/camera/c4077">Camera</a> Raw 7.0: Là  công cụ lựa chọn và điều chỉnh màu sắc, tô màu và các hình mẫu với kênh màu.

Điều gì đã sai ở đây? Và tại sao?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mọi người trên thế giới đang quá đề cao ý tưởng rằng khoa học và công nghệ là chìa khóa cho tiến bộ và thịnh vượng. Chúng ta đã quên làm một con người đơn giản và khiêm nhường - như những "người bình thường" đã vượt qua ung thư giai đoạn cuối mà chúng ta gặp trong các trang của <strong><em>Phòng và chữa bệnh ung thư theo phương thức tự nhiên.</em></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Điều chắc chắn là ai mà không ấn tượng bởi những đổi mới của khoa học và công nghệ cao mà chúng ta thấy ngày hôm nay? Ai mà không bị ấn tượng bởi cái gọi là phương thuốc diệu kỳ hoặc bức xạ, máy móc chẩn đoán hình ảnh tinh vi được sử dụng để điều trị ung thư?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Một điều rất dễ hiểu là hầu hết các bệnh nhân đều cảm thấy rằng, với tất cả những đổi mới này, những bác sĩ và các chuyên gia của họ có thể dễ dàng đối phó với căn bệnh ung thư. Nhưng, xin đừng bị mê muội. Hãy lắng nghe những gì các Giáo sư Richard Deyo và Donald Patrick của Đại học Washington, Mỹ, đã nói: <em>“Sự kết hợp của các ngành công nghiệp tham lam, sự thổi phồng của các phương tiện truyền thông, những thủ đoạn chính trị, và tư duy tiêu thụ công nghệ của chúng ta đang dẫn đến việc chúng ta ngày càng phụ thuộc nhiều hơn và thường xuyên hơn vào phương pháp điều trị tốn kém mà ít hiệu quả -</em> <em>và đôi khi hết sức nguy hiểm”</em>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sau một thập niên giúp đỡ bệnh nhân ung thư, TS. Chris K.H.Teo đã đi đến kết luận đơn giản sau:<strong> học vấn của bạn càng cao hoặc bạn càng có nhiều tiền, thì khả năng</strong><strong> bạn chết vì ung thư càng lớn!</strong> <strong>Cái chết này có thể là kết quả của phương pháp điều trị chứ không phải là do bản thân bệnh.</strong> <strong> </strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>  <lt;p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lắng nghe thông điệp từ thiên nhiên... nhẹ nhàng dưỡng trị</strong><strong> các tế bào nổi loạn của bạn để chúng trở lại bình thường </strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thông điệp (từ thiên nhiên) rất đơn giản: cơ thể có năng lực vô hạn trong việc tự chữa lành. Tương tự như vậy, ung thư không phải là do mầm bệnh hoặc vi trùng. Về cơ bản là do hệ thống miễn dịch đi sai hướng. Hóa trị, xạ trị và uống thuốc có tính độc lại tiếp tục phá hủy hệ thống miễn dịch của cơ thể. Như vậy, làm sao bạn mong đợi cơ thể có thể tự chữa lành bệnh được?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuốn sách của mình,<em> Cuộc chiến với Ung thư - Một giải phẫu về sự thất bại </em>(The War on Cancer – An Anatomy of Failure) Tiến sĩ Guy Faguet viết rằng <strong>việc cố gắng giết tất cả các tế bào ung thư (bằng liệu pháp hóa trị hoặc xạ trị) là dựa trên lý thuyết sai lầm</strong>. Đơn giản là nó không có nghĩa gì cả. Và làm bất cứ điều gì mà dựa vào những lý thuyết không hoàn thiện chắc chắn là cam chịu thất bại.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhưng mặt khác, có rất nhiều Nhà chữa bệnh theo tự nhiên, những người được nêu điển hình trong cuốn sách <strong>Phòng và chữa bệnh ung thư theo phương thức tự nhiên</strong>, những người dạy cho bệnh nhân phải sống với căn bệnh ung thư của mình như thế nào. Cố gắng để tiêu diệt kẻ thù bên trong bằng cách tạo ra một kho vũ khí tàn phá sẽ không đánh bại được kẻ thù. Thay vào đó, chính chủ nhà sẽ bị giết đầu tiên.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách này chứa đựng nhiều câu chuyện gợi cảm hứng của những người sống sót sau ung thư. Hãy tìm hiểu kinh nghiệm của họ, sao cho bạn cũng có thể phòng tránh và vượt qua được căn bệnh ung thư.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Trích đoạn:</strong></span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dee Page - "Thật kỳ diệu, hôm nay tôi còn ở đây"</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cô chỉ mới 32 tuổi đã phải đối mặt với cuộc khủng hoảng ung thư đầu tiên của mình.

Nhưng những thay đổi này chỉ là tạm thời."</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Con người lạc quan Dee đã càng hứng khởi bởi tiên lượng của bác sĩ phẫu thuật rằng"</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">chúng ta đã làm xong tất cả. "Tuy nhiên, cô vẫn tiếp tục phải chịu đựng cảm giác khó chịu và đau liên tục.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Hai năm sau, một khối ung thứ hai không thể phẫu thuật được.</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Những cơn đau liên tục gây ra bởi một khối u thứ hai phát triển trong hệ bạch huyết của khung xương chậu trái của Dee.

"Tôi đã thực hiện chương trình của bác sĩ Ian vào năm 1988 và sử dụng cuốn sách đầu tiên của ông ấy “Bạn có thể chinh phục bệnh ung thư" như một hướng dẫn cơ bản.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Một mô hình khác được Dee chấp nhận là một phương pháp được mô tả trong cuốn sách "Khỏe trở lại" của bác sĩ Carl &amp; Stephanie Simontons (1978),một cuốn sách bây giờ là một kinh điển trong việc sử dụng các kỹ thuật tâm-thân để chữa bệnh ung thư.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Bây giờ tôi đã phải đối mặt với thách thức lớn nhất của đời tôi. Tại sao tôi lại muốn sống? Khát vọng tuổi teen của tôi đã được hoàn thành nhưng tôi đã không đặt ra mục tiêu mới..."</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tôi nhận ra là tôi cần phải có một mục đích. "Mục đích của tôi bây giờ là để sống sót chống chọi với sự xung đột. Trong việc tìm kiếm một cách để tồn tại tôi có thể chia sẻ cuộc hành trình để giúp đỡ những người khác tự cứu lấy chính họ. "</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi đã làm rõ mục đích của mình, Dee cam kết toàn tâm toàn ý tập trung vào nghiên cứu các lựa chọn tổng thể đã mở ra cho cô.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cô biết rằng sự xung đột đang chống lại mình. Các chuyên gia ung thư đã nói với cô rằng bệnh ung thư đang tiến triển của cô là không thể mổ được và họ gợi ý thử điều trị bằng hóa và xạ trị xem sao, dù cơ hội sống nhờ cách đó chỉ có 10-15%. "Trước tôi chỉ mới có một phụ nữ khác được điều trị bằng cách này." Tôi quyết định tận dụng cơ hội mỏng manh này (10-15%) do họ cung cấp, 85% còn lại tôi sẽ tự chữa bệnh.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Dee nhớ lại rằng trong những ngày ấy cô thấy mình như bị ngập trong bóng tối, vì các nguồn chữa trị khác rất hạn chế. "Bạn đang sợ hãi, bạn cảm thấy rất cô đơn. Các bác sĩ và chuyên gia ung thư là tất cả những tri thức mà bạn biết từ họ. Vì vậy khi các chuyên gia này đưa ra niềm hy vọng ít ỏi đó cho cô, Dee hiểu rằng cuộc sống của cô chắc chắn phải dựa vào chính đôi tay của mình."</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Vào thời ấy, những khái niệm như "tự chịu trách nhiệm và đảm đương trách nhiệm" (mà là cái lõi cơ bản của chương trình NLP (Lập trình ngôn ngữ tư duy)-NDvề sự ốm đau của ai đó hầu như chưa được biết đến. Cái ý tưởng mà con người có thể thiền và nói về những sự lạc quan trong bệnh ung thư của ai đó nghe rất kỳ dị đối với nhiều người, thậm chí cho đến hôm nay.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Người có ảnh hưởng lớn cho cô về chữa bệnh là Bác sĩ Deepark Chopra-tác giả của cuốn sách về cách chữa bệnh đột phá, khai thác các khía cạnh của y học tâm-thân mãi tới 1989 mới được xuất bản.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chẳng có gì ngạc nhiên khi Dee hỏi các chuyên gia ung  thư về các Nhóm hỗ trợ ung</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">thư đó, họ xua tay ngay. "Chị sẽ không muốn làm gì với "Hội kỳ dị ấy đâu"-một trong số họ nói với Dee như vậy.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Dee với lòng biết ơn nhớ lại rằng chính "Hội kỳ dị" ấy (Hội hỗ trợ ung thư WA) đã chìa bàn tay giúp đỡ cô đầu tiên về cách trị bệnh và chỉ cho cô sức mạnh của năng lượng yêu thương.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> </strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>"Hội kỳ dị" và sự chữa bệnh tích cực.</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Những người chữa bệnh đã đến để đặt bàn tay lên cơ thể chúng tôi, những người tình nguyện cũng đến để dạy chúng tôi thiền. Trong một buổi chữa khi những bàn tay yêu thương đặt lên người tôi, một tia chớp màu trắng dường như đã tan biến đi. Đó là một cảm giác rất khó tả…nhưng trong khoảnh khắc đó tôi biết rằng đã có sự hi vọng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tôi đã khóc nức lên. Kể từ đó trở đi tôi đã trải nghiệm thêm 2 tia chớp ánh sáng nữa, tất cả đều làm tôi cảm thấy khỏe lên rất nhiều.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Dee (là người theo đạo Cơ đốc) cũng đã nói "cô đã cầu nguyện rất nhiều và xin được hướng dẫn làm thế nào để chữa khỏi bệnh. Tôi bị rất nhiều chấn thương về tình cảm cần được làm dịu bớt và chấm dứt."</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Khi tôi quán tưởng, tôi thấy khối u co rút lại và tôi đã cầu nguyện được trải nghiệm tương lai mong đợi ấy như thể nó hiện đang xảy ra.”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đồng thời Dee thay đổi căn bản chế độ ăn uống của mình. Cô đã trở thành người ăn chay 80% thời gian (ngoại trừ vẫn ăn cá và pho mát của Đức trong khi điều trị), và bắt đầu uống nước ép cỏ lúa mì cũng như các loại nước ép rau tươi tự  làm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Tại thời điểm (1988) việc uống nước ép cỏ tươi là “kỳ lạ.” Nhưng tất cả chiến lược toàn diện mạnh mẽ trên đã đóng vai trò lớn giúp Dee chịu đựng được đợt kết hợp thử nghiệm hóa trị và xạ trị ở Perth.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Điều đã mang lại cho người phụ nữ trẻ can đảm này niềm hi vọng và sức mạnh chính là tình thương yêu của gia đình cô, đặc biệt là chồng và những người bạn của cô.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Dee đã phải chịu đựng sự đau đớn kinh khủng khoảng 3 tháng, sau đó thật kỳ diệu khối u không thể mổ được đó đã biến mất. Nhưng cô lại phải đối mặt với sự tàn phá còn lại của cơ thể mà không thể sửa lại được.(xem chương 6, Điều trị bằng y học hiện đại), mặc dù cô đã học được cách đối phó.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sau cú thử thách ung thư lần thứ hai nghiêm trọng này, Dee quyết định rằng cái thế giới truyền thông và tiếp thị đày stress này là không dành cho cô, vì giờ đây cô đã hồi phục, đã theo một khóa học ngắn về tư vấn và bây giờ đã có đủ sức mạnh và tự tin để tham gia tư vấn cho các bệnh nhân khác về sức khỏe.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Tôi đã điều khiển những cuộc hội thảo về thiền và các phiên làm việc của Nhóm chữa bệnh" ở Singapore và Peth. Cùng lúc, Dee quay về học khoa Nhân văn bởi vì "Tôi muốn có một phương tiện để đưa thông tin của tôi ra thế giới."</p>', '2016-10-14', 0, 30, 16, 26, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 416, 10, 88000, 110000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bia_phong-va-chua-benh-ung-thu-theo-phuong-thuc-tu-nhien-01.u547.d20161025.t151737.663903.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Không giống như các phần miềm thương mại khác đều tốn khá  nhiều tiền, R hoàn toàn miễn phí. Bất cứ ai ở bất cứ nơi nào trên thế giới có truy cập mạng internet điều có thể tải R về máy tính, tốn vài phút cài đặt , và bắt đầu sử dụng. Trước đây, chỉ có một thiểu số nhà nghiên cứu (chủ yếu là các nước tiên tiến) mới có điều kiện sử dụng phần mềm thống kê, nhưng từ ngày có R thì bất cứ ai cũng đều có điều kiện áp dụng những phương pháp phân tích tinh vi nhất và hiện đại nhất cho nghiên cứu khoa học và phân tích dữ liệu. Do đó, sự ra đời của R đã làm cuộc cách mạng thống kê ở qui mô toàn cầu.

Hẳn bạn đang rất băn khoăn và trăn trở với hàng ngàn thắc mắc: làm thế nào để giúp bé làm quen với gia đình, bắt nhịp với cuộc sống mới lạ bên ngoài, làm thế nào để hiểu và đáp ứng đúng những nhu cầu của em bé sơ sinh chỉ mới biết dùng tiếng khóc làm công cụ duy nhất để giao tiếp đây. Những câu hỏi cứ liên tiếp nảy ra, bạn cuống cuồng tìm sự trợ giúp và giải đáp từ nhiều nguồn khác nhau, để rồi dễ dàng rơi vào một vòng xoáy sai lầm và một cuộc chiến mệt mỏi trong sự nghiệp nuôi con nhỏ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Những ngày đầu tiên bạn sẽ cố gắng cho bé bú liên tục, nhằm kích sữa, để con biết đây là mẹ. Đôi khi bạn sẽ đánh thức con dậy để cho con bú khi thấy bé ngủ li bì vì bạn sợ lâu quá con không bú sẽ bị đói. Bạn liên tục tự hỏi: con bú ít thế có đói không? Mình làm như thế có sao không? Con có ngủ được không? Con có nóng không? Con có lạnh không? Và làm thế nào để con tăng cân nhanh nhất có thể. Con tăng cân thế có chậm so với anh, chị, em hay con nhà hàng xóm không?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi được 4 tháng tuổi, tự nhiên bạn thấy con bú ít hẳn, con cáu gắt, con ngủ không yên, con dậy đêm nhiều lần. Bạn nghĩ là con đói, hốt hoảng cho con bú mỗi giờ. Con quấy khóc, chỉ có ti mẹ hay cái bình mới có thể cho con ngủ được. Và chỉ khi ngủ con mới chịu ăn. Mỗi giấc ngủ của con chỉ kéo dài 30 phút rồi con choàng dậy và kích động như chưa bao giờ được nghỉ ngơi. Đêm con dậy liên tục, con đòi bú, bạn nghĩ con ngày bú ít chắc cần bú bù, cả đêm bạn chẳng ngủ vì phục vụ “tiếp dưỡng” cho con. Mẹ mệt và cảm giác càng ngày con càng “khó tính”.6 tháng con bắt đầu ăn dặm, con cứ nhè chẳng ăn được bao nhiêu. Bạn quyết cho con nằm ngửa ra bón để chờ trọng lực của tự nhiên giúp thức ăn “rơi” vào bụng con. Sữa cũng vậy - cách duy nhất để uống sữa là nằm ngửa đút thìa, hay tệ hơn là uống bằng xi-lanh. Con vẫn quấy khóc đêm, dậy liên tục. Bạn cảm giác những đêm mất ngủ có lẽ sẽ kéo dài đến vô tận.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">9 tháng, cân nặng của con mãi không tăng, con cự tuyệt và sợ hãi với thức ăn. Sữa giờ phải bỏ ra đút thìa. Mà kể cả vậy, một thìa vào bụng con thì một thìa rơi xuống đất. Lãng phí. Bạn thấy thất vọng và bất lực với con.Bạn đọc hơn trăm trang tài liệu ăn dặm, các loại Tây Tàu Nhật Thổ, nhưng dường như con bạn là đối tượng không phù hợp với bất cứ phương pháp nào.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bạn đọc hơn trăm trang tài liệu ăn dặm, các loại Tây Tàu Nhật Thổ, nhưng dường như con bạn là đối tượng không phù hợp với bất cứ phương pháp nào.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mười mấy tháng con chào đời, bạn những tưởng con càng lớn sẽ càng dễ, nhưng không, mọi sự trở nên khó hơn. Lúc này, mỗi bữa ăn bạn phải cho con ra đường đi dạo, phải cho ra sân chơi, phải có <a href="http://tiki.vn/do-choi-qua-tang">đồ chơi</a> nếu con ngồi ghế, đi ăn nhà hàng là một cơn ác mộng. Con có thể đòi hỏi nhiều điều không tưởng, và bạn đáp ứng vô điều kiện, miễn là con ăn…. Cuối cùng con cũng không muốn ăn. Rồi con ăn vạ, con khóc, con dọa nôn ra thức ăn, và thế là bạn lại tìm mọi cách thực hiện yêu sách miễn là con không ăn vạ, con không nôn kẻo con lại sụt cân….</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bạn những tưởng con qua nấc 1 tuổi sẽ có thể cho bạn một giấc ngủ nguyên đêm, nhưng không, con vẫn thức dậy vài lần, mỗi đêm trằn trọc không ngon giấc. Bạn đi khám mọi bác sỹ dinh dưỡng, uống đủ các loại men tiêu hóa và cảm giác bất lực càng thêm bất lực vì bạn không thể thay đổi tự nhiên, không thể làm con béo, hay con ngủ ngoan…Hơn thế nữa, lúc nào bạn cũng cảm thấy như có thêm cái đuôi bất đắc dĩ, bạn vừa chạy ra ngoài 5 phút thì ở trong phòng đã nghe tiếng khóc nức nở. Bạn đi vào nhà tắm làm công tác bí mật cũng phải có khán giả bất đắc dĩ vừa nhăn mũi vừa nhăm nhăm trèo lên lòng . Lâu hơn chút, bạn cảm giác như mình có thêm ông vua bà chúa con trong nhà, thích gì là phải có ngay lập tức, trái ý là lăn đùng ra đất giãy giụa, tiếng khóc át tiếng bom, thậm chí còn dọa đập đầu vào tường, càng ở chốn đông người thì bạn càng được nghe ca nhạc kịch với âm lượng quá tải.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bạn thường xuyên trong tâm trạng lo sợ con ngã, con khóc; đôi khi bạn cảm thấy xấu hổ khi thấy người đi đường ngoái lại nhìn rồi xì xào nên lại chạy ra bế, ra ôm và lại đáp ứng mọi nhu cầu của các thượng đế tí hon. Hay thỉnh thoảng khi con bị ngã, bạn liền lập tức ra tay “đánh chừa” này, đôi khi ông bà cha mẹ lại được con “phát” miễn phí vài cái tát, hay vài dấu răng trên tay, trên vai. Những tưởng lớn dần bạn nói con sẽ hiểu, thế nhưng đời đâu như mơ, một ngày đẹp trời, thiên thần nhỏ của bạn chỉ biết nói duy nhất từ “không” đối với tất cả những gì bạn yêu cầu hay đòi hỏi ở con: tắm xong thì nhất quyết không chịu mặc quần áo, không chịu ngồi yên một chỗ để ăn, không chịu cất đồ chơi. Nói nhẹ không được chuyển qua nói nặng rồi ép buộc rồi dọa nạt, thế là ngôi nhà biến thành trận chiến nơi có tiếng la hét quát tháo của mẹ và những cơn nức nở của con…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nếu bất cứ trường hợp nào trên đây giống như những gì xảy ra ở gia đình bạn, thì cuốn sách này là dành cho bạn!</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách không là cẩm nang để bé ăn nhiều tăng cân nhanh hay dạy bé nghe lời răm rắp, mà giúp bạn hiểu con mình hơn. Giúp bạn hiểu chu kỳ sinh học của con và cách phối kết hợp cuộc sống gia đình với chu kỳ sinh học đó của bé. Hơn thế, cuốn sách còn hướng dẫn bạn cách cho ăn khi con đói, các thông tin kinh nghiệm và các trường hợp thực tế áp dụng thành công của các “bà mẹ tuyệt vọng” khác giúp bạn có thông tin cũng như nghị lực thay đổi cách áp dụng nuôi và dạy con ở gia đình. Suy cho cùng, nuôi không hẳn đã khó, đến đoạn dạy con còn khó hơn nhiều.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuối cùng đây là kinh nghiệm đặt những khuôn khổ hợp lý cho từng lứa tuổi, là bài học về tôn trọng trẻ thơ trong những khuôn khổ ấy. Nó sẽ làm cho kinh nghiệm làm mẹ của bạn ngọt ngào hơn và tránh cho con một tuổi thơ nước mắt bên bát cơm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mục Lục</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">PHẦN 1: NUÔI CON KHÔNG PHẢI  CUỘC CHIẾN</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chương 1: Ăn ngủ tự lập - Mẹ Nhàn con Ngoan</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chương 2: Những tuần phát triển kĩ năng và tinh thần (The Wonder Weeks)</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chương 3: Ăn dặm bé tự chủ - Baby-led weaning</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chương 4: Ăn để sống hay sống để ăn?

Trong những năm qua, sách đã được dịch ra nhiều thứ tiếng trên thế giới, tiếp cận được hàng triệu cha mẹ đang gặp rắc rối trong việc nuôi dạy con. Sự kết hợp giữa <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> thương và lý trí trong sách không chỉ giúp phụ huynh tìm được đường đi đúng trong sự nghiệp làm cha mẹ của mình mà còn tạo ra được <em>triết lý win – win</em> dành cho cả cha mẹ và con cái. Triết lý này đã được hàng triệu cha mẹ trải nghiệm, theo đó đôi bên đều chiến thắng: cha mẹ chiến thắng vì yêu con một cách sáng suốt, trẻ cũng chiến thắng vì có thể sống tự lập, có trách nhiệm. Gần gũi và kinh điển, thực tế nhưng không kém phần khoa học, cuốn sách giúp cha mẹ cách từng bước xây nên những viên gạch vững chắc trong suốt quá trình nuôi dạy trẻ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Nuôi con bằng yêu thương, dạy con bằng lý trí </em></strong>sẽ giúp cha mẹ:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Đặt yêu thương đúng nơi, trao lý trí đúng chỗ</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Xử trí hàng loạt được những thách thức mà hầu hết cha mẹ hiện nay phải đối mặt</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Nắm được những tình huống khiến trẻ hay nóng giận, cáu gắt, thiếu trách nhiệm</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Nuôi dạy nên một đứa trẻ tự lập, có trách nhiệm với bản thân</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với mục tiêu nuôi dạy những đứa trẻ tự lập, <strong><em>Nuôi con bằng yêu thương, dạy con bằng lý trí</em> </strong>được ví như kim chỉ nam dành cho những ai còn chưa tìm được hướng nuôi dạy con. Cha mẹ không nên tạo một môi trường vô trùng để bao bọc con, tính tự lập ở trẻ cũng không tự dưng mà có. Tất cả đều cần có một quá trình để cha mẹ thay đổi suy nghĩ, nhìn nhận lại cách nuôi con của mình và tìm ra được một phương pháp phù hợp.</p>', '2017-01-14', 0, 105, 51, 16, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 328, 3, 77000, 96000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/nuoi-con-bang-yeu-thuong-1.u547.d20170111.t135736.309883.png', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Nhưng kỳ lạ thay, khoa học - y học ngày càng phát triển, các loại máy móc hiện đại, các loại thuốc mới được phát minh nhưng cũng không theo kịp sự phát triển của các loại bệnh tật.

Ngoài ra, chúng tôi đưa vào một số truyện ngắn, truyện kể nhằm giúp người đọc bớt căng thẳng, nhưng vẫn nói lên Nhân quả - Báo ứng. Ví dụ, truyện về con sói (Ăn cháo đá bát) nói lên sự vô ơn; truyện “Trời ơi, con gái!” nói về sự kiêu căng; truyện “Bà ơi là bà ơi!” nói đến sự bất hiếu; và truyện “Chết đói” nói lên lòng nhân đạo...</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Theo cố nhà ngoại cảm có quyền năng huyền bí - Nguyễn Đức Cần - đã nói: “Con người có hai loại bệnh: Thân bệnh và nghiệp bệnh.

Những ngôi nhà cô xưa trong tập sách này đại diện cho một thời huy hoàng rực rỡ của những gia đình quan lại, thương gia, điền chủ giàu có của vùng đất Gia Định sau thời Minh Mạng, bao gồm miền Đông và miền Tây Nam Bộ. Là câu chuyện về nhà hát Thủ Dầu Một một thời lừng lẫy sáng đèn với những tên tuổi của đoàn hát Kim Chung, Kim Chưởng, Dạ Lý Hương, đoàn kịch Thẩm Thúy Hằng… giờ nhỏ bé của một thời kiến trúc xưa đã mất, dần lui về ân sâu trong những miền ký ức của những cụ ông, cụ bà ở tuổi “thất thập cổ lai hy”. Hay huyền thoại về Huỳnh Phủ ở Bến Tre, ngôi nhà xưa một thời nổi tiếng khắp vùng miền Tây Nam Bộ đã hơn trăm tuổi. Ngôi nhà của dòng họ Huỳnh là ngôi nhà Rường năm gian hai chái với bao thăng trầm thời cuộc, đầy ắp sóng gió cuộc đời thế thái nhân sinh.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đến thăm nhà Đốc Phủ Hải ở Gò Công, mọi người dễ choáng ngợp trước một tư dinh đồ sộ nằm trong thị xã nhỏ thuộc tỉnh Tiền Giang.

Mặt tiền chạm trổ tinh vi, các bức hoành, liễn cẩn xà cừ tinh xảo. Gian giữa đề hai Hán tự “YẾN DỰC” tượng trưng cho mùa xuân vui tươi, hưng thịnh. Tại đây, chúng ta được thưởng thức sự pha trộn Đông – Tây trong lối kiến trúc độc đáo thời thuộc địa; là tác phẩm kiến trúc độc đáo không chỉ của Gò Công và của cả miền Nam. Các đoàn làm phim cũng từng mượn nơi đây xây dựng bối cảnh cho các bộ phim “Con nhà nghèo”, “Nợ đời”…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với gần 180 trang sách, Ngô Kế Tựu đã dẫn dắt chúng ta đi khắp miền Nam đất nước, thăm lại những di tích xưa, chứng nhân của một thời lịch sử.

Được phát hành lần đầu vào ngày 9 tháng 11 năm 2010, hai năm sau khi Bush rời Nhà Trắng, cùng với đó là những chương trình giới thiệu sách trên truyền hình quốc gia và khắp nước Mỹ, hơn hai triệu bản in của cuốn sách đã được bán ra chỉ sau khi phát hành chưa đầy hai tháng, phá vỡ kỷ lục về doanh số trước đó của cuốn hồi ký <strong>My Life</strong> của cựu Tổng thống Bill Clinton. <strong>Những thời khắc quyết định</strong> cũng nhanh chóng nằm trong danh mục những cuốn sách bán chạy nhất theo bình chọn của tờ New York Times.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách giống như một thước phim quay chậm với hai chương đầu tiên được Bush dành để tái hiện lại cuộc sống của mình trước nhiệm kỳ tổng thống với những sự kiện đáng chú ý trong cuộc sống của ông như quyết định bỏ rượu năm 1986, quyết định chạy đua chức Thống đốc Texas rồi sau đó là tranh cử Tổng thống Hoa Kỳ. Mười hai chương còn lại đề cập chi tiết đến những sự kiện quan trọng trong suốt nhiệm kỳ tổng thống của ông: sự kiện ngày 11 tháng 9 năm 2001, các cuộc chiến ở Iraq và Afghanistan, các vấn đề trong nước và cải cách nhập cư, nghiên cứu tế bào gốc phôi,…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi nhìn lại các quyết định đã đưa ra, Bush viết: “Lịch sử có thể tranh luận về các quyết định tôi đưa ra, các chính sách tôi chọn và những công cụ tôi để lại. Nhưng không thể tranh luận về thực tế rằng: Sau cơn ác mộng ngày 11 tháng 9, nước Mỹ đã trải qua bảy năm rưỡi mà không có bất kỳ ý đồ tấn công khủng bố nào được thực hiện thành công.

Sự phát triển hiện nay của ngành y không gợi ra được tinh thần lạc quan. <br /><br />Sẽ phải trải qua vài chục năm nữa, khi mà những bác sĩ chui vào chỗ cuối cùng của con đường hầm không lối thoát, bởi vì họ không biết sẽ viết cho người bệnh đơn thuốc gì và giới thiệu cho người bệnh loại thuốc men nào. Các dược phẩm dần mất đi hiệu lực của mình còn bác sĩ thì cảm thấy hoàn toàn bất lực. Nếu như y học đã có dù chỉ là chút xíu sự hiểu biết về những khả năng thật sự của con người. Lẽ nào, các bác sĩ đã khép tôi án tử hình từ những ngày đầu tuổi thơ của tôi? Không lẽ họ không để lại cho tôi một cơ hội nào để sống khi họ đã từ chối tôi bằng niềm tin chắc chắn rằng tôi sẽ không sống được đến năm 20 tuổi.<br /><br />Giờ đây, ở phía sau tôi là những khám phá trường kỳ thú vị mang đầy tính khác thường. Nhưng điều cơ bản nhất là sự chiến thắng bản thân, chiến thắng bệnh tật và chiến thắng sự già nua của đời người. Tôi cố gắng chia sẻ một cách hào phóng toàn bộ cuộc sống bằng những khám phá của mình với mọi người. Tôi không mệt mỏi kêu gọi: Hãy tin vào bản thân, vào cơ thể mình. Đừng cam chịu bệnh tật. Hãy biết rằng các bạn có thể giành chiến thắng thậm chí là trước cái chết nếu như các bạn thật sự muốn điều này. Tôi đã làm được điều này, có nghĩa là các bạn cũng có thể làm được. Tôi không chỉ thoát chết, khỏi bệnh mà còn thiết lập ra chế độ cải thiện sức khỏe có thể giúp cho nhiều người thoát khỏi bệnh tật và bắt đầu sống một cách cao quý trọn vẹn. Họ sẽ được trẻ trung, khỏe mạnh, hạnh phúc mà không bị phụ thuộc vào tuổi trẻ. Nếu như chúng ta kiểm tra bản thân và bắt đầu khám phá những khả năng còn được giấu kín trong cơ thể thì sự sống trên trái đất này có thể kéo dài đến 100 thậm chí đến 120-130 tuổi ngay trong thời gian gần nhất. Điều này là hoàn toàn có thật bởi con người theo phép sinh học đã được lập trình trong khuôn thời gian sống rất dài. Tuy nhiên sự kéo dài cuộc sống ở đây không phải là sự kéo dài của tuổi già, mà là sự kéo dài của tuổi trẻ - tuổi thanh xuân. Kinh nghiệm của riêng tôi nói lên rằng điều này là hoàn toàn có thể."<br /><br /><strong>(Nishi Katsuzo)</strong><br /><br /><br /></p>', '2016-01-14', 0, 301, 16, 32, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 280, 5, 56000, 70000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bia_pp_phuc_hoi_suc_khoe_theo_tu_nhien-01.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Chuyện hôm qua đã là chuyện hôm kia mất rồi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chúng ta thường dễ buồn vì những gì đã qua, những thứ vụt mất khỏi tầm tay trong một ngày nhiều nỗi ngổn ngang rối rắm. Mối bận tâm ấy rối tung như tơ vò, chồng chất ngày qua ngày, đến độ bản thân nhận thấy cảm xúc phút chốc bị đóng hộp, chẳng cách nào giải phóng những nỗi buồn không tên ấy. <strong>Minh Mẫn</strong> có cách vực dậy tinh thần đang bế tắc của bạn, bằng những trang văn  đầy lạc quan. Là chuyện về chàng trai năm ấy đã từng thổ lộ: “Nếu cậu chưa yêu ai, hãy để dành điều đó cho tớ.” Là mối tình đầu chia xa vì quá nhiều những lý do chẳng thể lí giải. Là mái ấm gia đình gần gũi, nơi bạn được cưng chiều và nhận về tất cả sự yêu thương từ cha mẹ. Giọng văn của Mẫn ẩn hiện sự lém lỉnh tươi vui nhưng cũng giàu tâm sự và khắc khoải trong việc khơi gợi sự đồng cảm nơi bạn đọc. Phụ nữ trưởng thành hơn sau những nỗi đau, những nông nổi và lo lắng một thời thanh xuân giờ nhớ lại chỉ thường trực một nụ cười nơi khóe môi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hạnh phúc là khi ta biết dừng lại đúng lúc. Không bước quá xa. Không đi quá sâu. Đừng xây nỗi buồn quá lớn. Đừng nuôi hy vọng quá nhiều.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Xuyên suốt mạch văn của Mẫn, những câu chuyện kể gần gũi của <strong>Du Phong</strong> xuất hiện như một con ong tận tụy, điểm xuyết thêm cho khu vườn ngôn từ trở nên sinh động. Khi bằng lời thơ da diết , khi bằng con chữ tròn đầy. Dù ở khía cạnh nào, <strong>Du Phong </strong>cũng khiến người đọc bất ngờ bởi chính những cảm nhận tinh tế của mình, chưa một lần khiến những ai yêu mến cậu thất vọng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"Ai cũng từng thương một ai đó trong đời</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Có thể cùng đến nơi, có thể rời xa mãi</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Dẫu thế nào, đến cuối cùng dừng lại</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Cũng nên vui, bởi đã hết lòng mình."</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Những gì đã qua đừng nghĩ lại quá nhiều, quá khứ đi rồi đừng nên ngoảnh lại, hãy nhìn về phía trước, hướng về những điều tươi đẹp trong tương lai.

Và thế là<strong> Những con chữ biết hát</strong> ra đời. Đây là cuốn tự truyện thứ hai của cậu bé - là những dòng tâm sự của cậu về quá trình mình lớn lên bên bố mẹ, thầy cô, bạn bè và những gì cậu học được từ những năm tháng chập chững đầu đời ấy. Ta sẽ lại được gặp một <strong>Nhật Nam</strong> gần gũi và đáng yêu qua những chia sẻ chân thành, pha chút “già dặn” của cậu bé.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Những con chữ biết hát</strong> đầy ắp những kỉ niệm của bé Nam về tuổi thơ ở Nhật - nơi có những chiếc xe Bus “sặc sỡ”, những chuyến tàu cao tốc, những bức tường biết hát, những giáng sinh tuyết phủ trắng xóa … Đó cũng là những trang viết về các bài học cuộc sống mà Nhật Nam nhận được từ bố, từ mẹ, từ thầy cô và từ chính những người bạn cùng lớp của mình. Cuốn sách giúp ta có cái nhìn gần hơn với Đỗ Nhật Nam, cậu bé không phải là một thần đồng, cậu chỉ là một cậu bé bình thường, sớm được tiếp nhận được một nền giáo dục phù hợp, nghiêm khắc nhưng không gò bó mà đong đầy yêu thương. Bé vừa học vừa được thỏa sức vui chơi và khám phá thế giới quanh mình. Cũng chính vì thế, cả cuốn sách tràn ngập những tưởng tượng của Nam, những điều bình dị của cuộc sống được nhìn qua lăng kính trẻ thơ của bé hiện lên thật sống động, đầy màu sắc:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Lúc còn nhỏ, tớ không nghĩ đến những điều cao siêu đó, cũng chẳng nghĩ những gì mình mơ mộng chính là tưởng tượng. Tớ tin mọi điều sẽ trở thành sự thật. Bằng cách đó, tớ thấy mình không nhỏ nhoi, không chỉ là đứa bé ba tuổi chạy lon ton theo chân mẹ. Tớ thấy mình được là nhiều nhân vật khác nhau. Nhờ tưởng tượng mà tớ tự làm được nhiều việc, thấy mình có nhiều khả năng. Chỉ mong người lớn hãy để trẻ được tự do với những tưởng tượng của mình. Đó là một thế giới riêng mà chỉ những đứa trẻ cùng tuổi mới biết. Tớ cũng ước ao, mỗi con đường, mỗi góc phố, mỗi ngôi nhà có một không gian riêng, bé thôi, nhỏ xíu thôi nhưng là nơi mà trẻ được đứng đó, tần ngần và bâng khuâng.

Hãy đọc để cảm nhận. Tôi tin các bạn sẽ có câu trả lời và nhận xét giống chúng tôi. Bởi lẽ đây thực sự là một tài liệu tham khảo quý và cần thiết.<br /><br />Cái quý trước hết ở thể văn. Văn nghị luận xã hội là một mảng quan trọng nhất trong chương trình văn phổ thông. Bắt đầu từ lớp 7 cho đến khi thi tốt nghiệp cấp III. Mọi bài kiểm tra, bài thi đều không thể thiếu đề nghị luận xã hội. Hơn nữa, trên cả thi cử, những bài văn nghị luận xã hội còn cung cấp cho chúng ta cái nhìn đa chiều về cuộc sống. Giúp ta biết nhìn nhận, đánh giá và xác định quan điểm về nhiều mặt của đời sống xã hội.<br /><br />Cái quý thứ hai khiến cuốn sách Những bài văn nghị luận xã hội chọn lọc  trở nên đáng đọc chính là bởi nguồn gốc của nó. Đây là những bài văn hay nhất được chọn lọc từ cuộc thi Bài văn hay do công ty sách Việt kết hợp với báo Mực tím tổ chức đầu năm 2016. Học từ bạn bè, học từ những người bạn giỏi nhất chính là thông điệp chúng tôi muốn gửi gắm qua cuốn sách. Bấy lâu nay con em học trò chúng ta đang bị sa quá nhiều vào những bài văn mẫu của các chuyên gia, các thầy cô mà ít được đọc được học từ bạn bè. Cái nhìn quan điểm có phần già dặn, khuôn sáo. Vì vậy những bài văn hay từ bạn bè cùng trang lứa sẽ là kho tư liệu quý để chúng ta học hỏi và quan trọng hơn để chúng ta biết rằng bạn bè ta đang giỏi như thế nào mà nỗ lực và cố gắng. <br /><br />Cái quý thứ ba là đề tài đa dạng mà cuốn sách mang lại. Đây không phải một cuốn sách để ta học tủ học gạo mà là kho tư liệu sẽ theo ta từ lớp 7 đến lớp 12, là cái nhìn đa chiều về những vấn đề thiết thực song cũng rất đỗi nhân văn từ cuộc sống. Từ những chủ đề nóng hổi với giới trẻ như “cái nhìn về sự nổi tiếng. Có nên chăng cố sống cố chết nổi tiếng bằng mọi giá”. Đến những vấn đề chính trị thời sự như “Sức mạnh của giáo dục”. Hay đơn giản chỉ là những rung động, sự nhìn nhận quan điểm ta học được sau một bộ phim sâu lắng Tôi đã thấy hoa vàng trên cỏ xanh. Xem phim, suy ngẫm để nhận ra rằng “Hãy yêu thương khi bạn còn có thể”. Những vấn đề nghị luận được các bạn lựa chọn rất sâu sắc. “Đời thay đổi khi ta thay đổi”, “Nếu muốn thấy cầu vồng phải chấp nhận những cơn mưa”. Vấn đề được nhìn nhận đa chiều  “Phải chăng chỉ có ngọt ngào mới làm nên hạnh phúc”. Những đề tài mà các em lựa chọn không những thực tế, giàu tính nhân văn mà còn khiến ta tự hào vì giới trẻ thời nay đã hiểu rằng: “Bạn không thể thay đổi quá khứ nhưng có thể thay đổi tương lai”. “Tuổi trẻ không phải là cái cớ cho sự thờ ơ”. “Vì sao tôi sống”... Những bài văn tâm huyết. Những quan điểm, dẫn chứng lập luận chặt chẽ cho ta cái nhìn toàn diện hơn về suy nghĩ, quan điểm của giới trẻ với các vấn đề của đời sống xã hội.<br /><br />Không chỉ tập trung vào nội dung. Hình thức trang nhã được chau chuốt công phu của cuốn sách chắc chắn sẽ làm xiêu lòng bạn ngay từ phút đầu tiên nhìn thấy. <br /><br />Cuốn sách nhỏ chứa đựng giá trị to. Mỗi bài viết là một tâm huyết, một cái nhìn, một quan điểm của các bạn trẻ về những vấn đề khác nhau của đời sống. Cuốn sách như một cẩm nang quý báu, là của để dành trong những năm tháng tuổi học trò. Để một lúc nào đó cần tìm nguồn cảm hứng, cần một chút ý tưởng, cần học cách hành văn lập luận hay giản đơn là tìm dẫn chứng... ta đều có thể biết rằng: Ta cần đọc ở đâu!<br /><br /><strong>NHỮNG AI NÊN ĐỌC SÁCH?</strong><br /><br />Những bài văn nghị luận xã hội chọn lọc không chỉ là cuốn sách dành cho học sinh từ lớp 7 đến lớp 12.  Đây còn là tư liệu hữu ích với cả quý phụ huynh và thầy cô giáo.<br /><br />Cha mẹ đọc sách để hiểu về con. Để hiểu suy nghĩ tâm tư cách nhìn nhận của một bộ phận không nhỏ giới trẻ tài năng từ đó ta có cái nhìn, sự so sánh đánh giá phù hợp hơn năng lực cảm thụ, viết lách và kỹ năng tư duy trình bày của con em mình. <br /><br />Thầy cô đọc sách để có thêm cái nhìn, sự đánh giá đa chiều và rút ra những bài học từ cái hay, cái thiếu sót trong các bài văn nghị luận. Ta đều biết rằng sau lưng một học sinh giỏi luôn có bóng dáng của thầy cô ưu tú. Vì vậy qua những bài văn hay nhất được tuyển chọn của các bạn học sinh giỏi văn khắp cả nước các thầy cô cũng sẽ có thêm nhưng tư liệu, những bài học bổ ích để bồi dưỡng năng lực chuyên môn của mình.<br /><br />Và đương nhiên rồi. Các bạn học sinh phổ thông trên cả nước. Một tài liệu bổ ích đang trong tầm tay bạn.

Trước hết là một điều bình thường ở cộng đồng, cậu mơ thấy mình muốn tắm cho Fiona lõa thể trong bồn nước mà không được. Cậu đã có một trải nghiệm, và đã phải uống thuốc - loại thuốc triệt cảm xúc - để giấc mơ chỉ đến một lần. Sau đó, khi tung quả táo, Jonas nhìn thấy một cái gì vượt ra ngoài biên giới.

Jonas bàng hoàng đau khổ, nhưng vẫn dũng cảm tiếp nhận để gánh vác bớt những cơn dày vò đang hành hạ người thầy của mình.

Xin thưa, đó chính là NĂNG LƯỢNG!</p>  <p>Vạn vật đều là năng lượng.</p>  <p>Năng lượng không được tạo ra, cũng không thể phá hủy.</p>  <p>Tự nó đã mang tính nhân quả.</p>  <p>Nó hiện diện như nhau ở mọi lúc, mọi nơi.</p>  <p>Năng lượng chuyển động vĩnh hằng và không bao giờ ngừng nghỉ.</p>  <p>Nó chỉ chuyển hóa từ dạng này sang dạng khác, luôn luôn như vậy.</p>  <p>SUY NGHĨ SINH RA NĂNG LƯỢNG.</p>  <p>Trong vũ trụ này không có gì là thừa cả. Mỗi người có mặt trên cõi đời này vì họ cần lấp đầy một khoảng trống nào đó, và tất cả các mảnh nhỏ đều phải vừa khít với chỗ của nó trong tấm xếp hình khổng lồ của vũ trụ.</p>  <p style="text-align: right;"><em>Deepak Chopra</em></p>  <p> </p>  <p><em>Bạn được kết nối</em></p>  <p>Bạn được kết nối với vạn vật và với tất cả mọi người. Bạn là một thể độc nhất vô nhị, một thể hoàn chỉnh, một mảnh ghép không thể thiếu trong toàn thể vũ trụ bao la này. Bạn là một trái bóng năng lượng trong một trường năng lượng rộng lớn hơn. Bạn là một phần của nguồn năng lượng lớn lao hơn; bạn là một phần của Chúa. Sự thông thái của cả vũ trụ cũng là của bạn, nếu bạn yêu cầu.</p>  <p>Hãy nghĩ tới mạng internet. Bạn không thể nhìn thấy, cũng không thể chạm vào nó, nhưng bạn biết nó có tồn tại. Nó có thực. Nó là một nguồn năng lượng vô hình kết nối tất cả chúng ta với nhau. Bạn cũng được kết nối với mọi người và mọi vật, mọi việc theo cách tương tự như vậy.</p>  <p>Đã bao giờ bạn nhận thấy với những người bạn thường xuyên gần gũi, thỉnh thoảng bạn có thể tiếp lời họ, hoặc cả hai bạn có thể nói một câu cùng lúc hay chưa? Đó không phải là sự ngẫu nhiên, mà là sự gắn kết! Đây là ví dụ điển hình cho thấy thật ra chúng ta được kết nối với những người xung quanh mình như thế nào.</p>  <p>Tất cả chúng ta, ai cũng từng trải qua chuyện như thế này: khi chúng ta vừa mới bắt đầu nghĩ tới một người mà có thể chúng ta đã không nhìn thấy, hoặc không nói chuyện trong nhiều năm liền thì bỗng vài phút sau chuông <a href="https://tiki.vn/dien-thoai-smartphone/c1795">điện thoại</a> reo, và họ - người mà chúng ta vừa mới nghĩ tới - đang ở đầu dây bên kia. “Mình vừa mới nghĩ tới cậu xong!”, chúng ta thốt lên kinh ngạc. Thật ra chúng ta đã xuất hiện trong ý định gọi cho chúng ta của họ trước cả khi họ biến ý định đó thành hành động. Suy nghĩ của chúng ta di chuyển qua không gian và thời gian với một vận tốc đáng ngạc nhiên. Thông qua sự kết nối của mình, bạn có thể bắt được nguồn năng lượng từ suy nghĩ và ý định của họ trước khi họ bấm số, mà cũng có thể chính suy nghĩ của bạn về họ đã kích thích họ gọi cho bạn.</p>  <p>Nhờ có Luật Hấp dẫn, mỗi người trong chúng ta giống như một thỏi nam châm có sức hút lớn, hấp dẫn được nhiều hơn những gì chúng ta cảm nhận được vào một thời điểm nhất định nào đó.</p>  <p style="text-align: right;"><em>Esther và Jerry Hicks</em></p>  <p> </p>  <p><em>Bạn là một thỏi nam châm</em></p>  <p>Bạn là một thỏi nam châm sống. Bạn hút, theo đúng nghĩa đen của từ này, người, vật, ý tưởng và các tình huống có tần số năng lượng rung động và cộng hưởng như của bạn về phía mình. Trường năng lượng của bạn thường xuyên thay đổi, nó phụ thuộc vào suy nghĩ và cảm xúc của bạn, và vũ trụ giống như một chiếc gương phản chiếu chính xác nguồn năng lượng mà bạn đã tạo ra. Suy nghĩ và cảm xúc của bạn mãnh liệt bao nhiêu thì lực hút sẽ mạnh bấy nhiêu. Quá trình này không đòi hỏi bất kì một sự nỗ lực thật sự nào; nam châm không phải “cố” hút vật - mà đơn giản, nó có đặc tính hút vật. Và bạn cũng vậy! Bạn vẫn luôn trong quá trình hút thứ gì đó vào cuộc sống của mình.</p>  <p>Bạn có nhận ra rằng cuộc sống hiện tại của bạn chính là kết quả của mọi thứ mà bạn đã từng nghĩ, từng làm, từng tin tưởng hoặc từng cảm nhận cho tới tận bây giờ hay không? Ngay lúc này, bạn có thể bắt đầu chủ động hấp dẫn, và hấp dẫn một cách trí tuệ, bất cứ thứ gì bạn khao khát trong cuộc sống này. Bằng việc sử dụng Luật Hấp dẫn, bạn có thể hấp dẫn con người, niềm vui, tiền bạc, ý tưởng, chiến lược và cả tình huống - tất cả mọi thứ bạn cần để có thể mang lại cho mình một cuộc sống như bạn mơ ước.</p>  <p>Cả con người chúng ta đều là kết quả của những gì chúng ta nghĩ.</p>  <p style="text-align: right;"><em>Đức Phật</em></p>  <p> </p>  <p><em>Bạn có quyền năng</em></p>  <p>Bạn có quyền năng hơn nhiều so với những gì bạn vẫn nghĩ. Bạn đang tạo ra mọi thứ trong cuộc sống của chính bản thân mình. Một khi bạn hiểu thấu đáo điều này và chịu trách nhiệm về nó, bạn có thể làm bất cứ điều gì bạn đặt ra. Bạn là tác giả cuộc đời mình và bạn có thể chọn cho nó bất kì con đường nào bạn thích.</p>  <p>Bạn có khả năng thay đổi cuộc sống của bạn.</p>  <p>Bạn có khả năng kiến tạo tương lai như bạn mong ước.</p>  <p>Tài năng của bạn là vô hạn!</p>  <p>Một khi bạn đưa ra quyết định, vũ trụ sẽ hiệp lực với bạn để biến điều đó thành hiện thực.</p>  <p style="text-align: right;"><em>Ralph Waldo Emerson</em></p>  <p> </p>  <p><em>Những nội dung khác</em></p>  <p>Jack Canfield là nhà đồng sáng lập, đồng thời là đồng tác giả của seri sách bán chạy nhất do New York Times bình chọn: Chicken Soup for the Souls gồm 146 câu chuyện đã bán được hơn 100 triệu bản với hơn 47 thứ tiếng trên thế giới.

Là một trong số ít những cuốn sách được đánh giá cao về giáo dục gia đình, Người Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt gồm bảy chương với các chủ đề khác nhau, theo trẻ trừ khi còn nhỏ cho đến lúc trưởng thành. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Người Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt đưa ra nhiều quan điểm mà các bậc cha mẹ phải lưu ý khi dạy trẻ bởi có thể đối với người lớn, đó là vấn đề rất nhỏ nhặt nhưng với con trẻ lại là chuyện lớn. Cuốn sách phân tích và nhận xét toàn diện quanh việc giáo dục con cái như điểm số, học hành, giải trí, khen, phạt,... Những kinh nghiệm trong sách được tác giả đúc rút bằng chính trải nghiệm của bản thân mình qua việc dạy dỗ con cái. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Người Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt đánh giá rất cao vai trò của giáo dục gia đình trong việc định hình nhân cách những đứa trẻ. Và tất nhiên, không thể thiếu trong mọi phương pháp dạy trẻ, Người Mẹ Tốt Hơn Là Người Thầy Tốt có nền tảng bằng <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> thương của người mẹ dành cho con.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: large;">©</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách Người mẹ tốt hơn là người thầy tốt là một cuốn sổ tay về cách nuôi dạy con của nhà giáo, thạc sĩ Doãn Kiến Lợi. Chị đã tổng kết kinh nghiệm gần hai mươi năm nuôi dạy con, đồng thời kết hợp với một nền tảng lí thuyết vững chắc và kinh nghiệm thực tế có được trong quá trình trực tiếp dạy học cũng như tiếp xúc với khá nhiều trẻ em, từ đó đúc rút ra được những bài học quý báu trong cuốn sách này.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Người mẹ tốt hơn là người thầy tốt</strong> đề cập đến rất nhiều vấn đề lớn nhỏ trong quá trình nuôi dạy con cái, nhưng tựu chung lại có thể gói gọn  thành hai vế: đó là nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn và trí tuệ của con trẻ. Tác giả không viết về những thứ quá vĩ mô và trừu tượng mà ngược lại, thạc sĩ Doãn Kiến Lợi nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn và trí tuệ của trẻ từ những điều đơn giản nhất, như chính tác giả đã viết “Với trẻ em không có chuyện nhỏ, mọi chuyện nhỏ đối với trẻ đều là chuyện lớn”.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách được trình bày dưới dạng những bài viết nhỏ, mỗi bài viết đề cập đến một vấn đề trong quá trình nuôi dạy con cái mà hầu hết các bậc phụ huynh đều gặp phải như làm thế nào để trẻ không sợ tiêm, trả lời thế nào khi trẻ hỏi em bé từ đâu đến, làm thế nào khi con trẻ nói dối, tạo lập những phẩm chất tính cách tốt đẹp cho con trẻ… đến những vấn đề trong học tập như dạy con biết chữ, làm toán, viết văn… Những bài viết này rất chân thực, gần gũi, dễ hiểu, không đi vào lối mòn sáo rỗng và nặng về lí thuyết, rất dễ dàng cho các bậc phụ huynh đọc và ứng dụng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ngoài ra, trong cuốn sách này, thạc sĩ Doãn Kiến Lợi cũng đề cập đến một số vấn đề bất cập trong hệ thống giáo dục Trung Quốc và các đối sách cần có của các bậc phụ huynh. Hệ thống giáo dục của Việt Nam có nhiều điểm tương đồng với hệ thống giáo dục của Trung Quốc, vì vậy bạn đọc cũng có thể tham khảo và tự tìm ra cho mình những cách giải quyết riêng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tác giả cuốn sách là một nhà giáo, một chuyên gia giáo dục có nhiều năm làm công tác giảng dạy, tư vấn và nghiên cứu giáo dục gia đình, nhưng trên hết chị còn là một người mẹ. Vì vậy, trong cuốn sách này, ngoài những quan niệm giáo dục độc đáo đầy trí tuệ, người đọc còn có thể bắt gặp tình yêu con sâu sắc ngập tràn trong từng trang viết của chị. Tác giả quan niệm: Các bậc phụ huynh cần đứng trên góc độ của con trẻ để nhìn nhận vấn đề, đừng bắt ép con trẻ sống theo lối sống mà người lớn áp đặt cho chúng. Bởi vì “trẻ em là một thế giới tồn tại độc lập hoàn mỹ, trong cơ thể bé nhỏ của chúng ẩn chứa sức sống mạnh mẽ vô biên, trong quá trình trưởng thành chúng có một tiềm lực biểu đạt tự mình nhào nặn, tự mình thành hình, giống như bên trong một hạt giống có ẩn chứa rễ, lá, hoa, trong điều kiện thích hợp tự nhiên sẽ phát triển (Trích “Người mẹ tốt hơn là người thầy tốt”). Đây thực sự là một quan niệm giáo dục độc đáo và đầy tiến bộ, rất đáng cho chúng ta nghiên cứu và học hỏi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách phù hợp cho những người làm công tác giáo dục, quan tâm đến giáo dục và những người sắp làm cha, làm mẹ cũng như các bậc phụ huynh có con ở độ tuổi thiếu nhi đến độ tuổi mười bảy, mười tám.</p>', '2015-03-14', 0, 83, 5, 37, 'NXB Văn Học', 'null', 583, 1, 111000, 139000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/nguoi-me-tot-hon-la-thay-tot.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Ở nhà hay nơi công cộng, chỉ cần điểm xuyết thêm một hai cây cảnh hoặc vài bông hoa là đã trở nên thời thượng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cây cảnh là một viên minh châu trong lâm viên của Trung Quốc, có lịch sử lâu đời và rất được mọi người yêu thích. Nghệ thuật cây cảnh chính là sự kết hợp giữa kỹ thuật trồng và tạo dáng cây cảnh, đồng thời là sự hoà hợp giữa vẻ đẹp tự nhiên và vẻ đẹp nghệ thuật. Cây cảnh lấy thực vật, nước, đá v.v… làm vật liệu, được gia công nghệ thuật chăm sóc tỉ mỉ thông qua bàn tay và khối óc của các nghệ nhân làm vườn. Nó bắt nguồn từ tự nhiên, từ cuộc sống nhưng cao hơn tự nhiên, cao hơn cuộc sống, chẳng hạn như hình ảnh con rồng qua bàn tay các nghệ nhân được thu nhỏ lại trong chiếc chậu bé xíu, tái hiện những thắng cảnh của tự nhiên bao la.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cây cảnh tuy do con người tạo ra nhưng lại khéo hơn cả tạo hoá.

Mục tiêu cuả một thương vụ là đảm bảo khách hàng nhận được giá trị tương xứng, nhưng nếu bạn mang đến cho khách hàng những giá trị còn cao hơn giá trị mà lẽ ra họ sẽ nhận được thì không những bạn đã có một thương vụ thành công mà bạn còn có thêm một khách hàng sẵn lòng giúp bạn có thêm nhiều khách hàng khác nữa.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuốn sách kinh doanh này, bạn sẽ có cơ hội làm quen với nhiều người bán hàng sẵn sàng từ bỏ một thương vụ bởi họ biết rằng thương vụ đó không mang lại lợi ích tốt nhất cho khách hàng của mình. Khi đó, bán hàng trở nên giống như thi đấu thể thao, nhà vô địch quần vợt phải biết đánh bóng sao cho anh ta có thể đánh cú tiếp theo hiệu quả hơn, hay các tay gôn kỳ cựu cũng vậy. Nếu nhân viên bán hàng không quan tâm đến việc xây dựng và duy trì mối quan hệ tốt đẹp với khách hàng mà chỉ chăm chăm kiếm tiền từ túi người khác thì đảm bảo rằng họ sẽ nhanh chóng bị đào thải khỏi nghề này.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi đọc cuốn sách <strong>Nghệ Thuật Bán Hàng Bậc Cao</strong>, các bạn cần linh động áp dụng từng nguyên tắc hay nghiều nguyên tắc cùng lúc để phù hợp với sản phẩm của bạn cũng như yêu cầu của khách hàng. Cuốn sách bao gồm rất nhiều ví dụ minh hoạ và những câu chuyện thực tế, được viết theo lối kể chuyện tự nhiên, do vậy bạn cần phải chủ động học hỏi - chứ không chỉ đơn giản chỉ đọc nó mà thôi. Một cuốn sổ tay nhỏ sẽ rất hữu ích trong việc giúp bạn ghi lại những ý tưởng quan trọng. Bạn hãy mạnh dạn đánh dấu vào sách những câu từ cần ghi nhớ và đừng lo lắng là nó sẽ bị cũ hay xấu đi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nên đọc quyển <strong>Nghệ Thuật Bán Hàng Bậc Cao </strong>này như thế nào?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nội dung cuốn sách được viết theo lối kể chuyện, kết hợp với rất nhiều đoạn hội thoại và những mẫu chuyện vui. Hơn 700 câu hỏi và 250 chiến thuật kinh doanh, chiêu thức cũng như các cách thức kết thúc một thương vụ được gói gọn trong gần 100 câu chuyện, bài phân tích và nhiều câu chuyện khác nhau sẽ đem đến cho bạn cảm giác thú vị khi đọc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nhận định</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Nếu như chỉ gọi Zig Ziglar là một người bán hàng siêu hạng thì vẫn chưa đủ. Cuốn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-kinh-te/c846">sách kinh tế</a> này là tập hợp những hiểu biết về nghệ thuật bán hàng mà ông đã dày cong sưu tầm.

Phần lớn những quyết định và chính sách trong đơn vị của Tác giả trong suốt thời gian tác giả giữ chức Phó Chủ tịch đều được suy động bỏi những nguyên tắc mà bạn sẽ tìm thấy trong cuốn sách này.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Những nguyên tắc này là gì? Chúng ta có thể chia chúng làm ba.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Nguyên tắc thứ nhất là việc kinh doanh phải thành công: Tức là nó phải tạo ra tiền. Có một sự tin tưởng phổ biến tại Mỹ và tại các nước Phương Tây rằng thành đạt, làm ra tiền, một cách nào đó, là một sai lầm đối với những ai đang nỗ lực có một cuộc sống tâm linh. Trong Phật giáo, dù tiền bạc tự nó không phải là xấu, thực ra, một người có nhiều tiền bạc có thể làm được nhiều việc thiện trên đời này hơn là không có nó. Vấn đề chính là chúng ta làm ra tiền bằng cách nào, chúng ta có hiểu được tiền phát sinh từ đâu không và làm sao để tiền tiếp tục đến và chúng ta có giữ được một thái độ lành mạnh về tiền hay không.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Nguyên tắc thứ hai là chúng ta nên hưởng thụ tiền bạc, tức là chúng ta cần phải học cách giữ cho tinh thần và thân thể của chúng ta được lành mạnh trong khi chúng ta làm ra tiền. Hoạt động tạo ra tài sản không được làm cho chúng ta quá mệt mỏi cả thể xác lẫn tinh thần đến nỗi chúng ta không thể hưởng thụ được tài sản. Một <a href="http://tiki.vn/doanh-nhan/c483">doanh nhân</a> tàn phá sức khoẻ khi kinh doanh tức là làm tiêu tan mục đích thực sự của việc kinh doanh.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Nguyên tắc thứ ba là bạn phải quay nhìn lại cho được sự nghiệp kinh doanh của bạn, cuối cùng và thành thật mà nói rằng bao năm làm kinh doanh của bạn đã có một ý nghĩa nào đó.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Tóm lại, mục đích kinh doanh, hay của trí tuệ cổ Tây Tạng và thực ra là của mọi nỗ lực của con người, chính là làm cho chính chúng ta được phong phú - đạt được sự thịnh vượng, cả bên ngoài lẫn bên trong. Chúng ta chỉ có thể hưởng thụ sự thịnh vượng này nếu như chúng ta giữ được một mức độ cao về sức khoẻ thể chất và tinh thần. Trong suốt cuộc đời của mình, chúng ta phải tìm cách để làm cho sự thịnh vượng này có ý nghĩa theo một cách hiểu rộng hơn.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Mời các bạn đón đọc!</strong><br /></span></p>', '2011-12-14', 0, 112, 16, 1, 'NXB Tri Thức', 'null', 348, 2, 71000, 89000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/nang-doan-kim-cuong-2011-a.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Kế đó, nếu chúng ta sử dụng phương pháp này cho người khác với động cơ đúng đắn của việc thực hành một sự bố thí vô ngã - như từng được thực hiện một cách rộng rãi bởi nhiều bậc thầy vĩ đại của Tây Tạng - thì đây sẽ là một phương tiện thúc đẩy sự thực hành Bồ Tát đạo.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;">Ngoài ra phương pháp tiên tri Mo còn có một chức năng thứ yếu nữa. Giáo lý trọng tâm và sâu xa nhất của Đức Phật là giáo lý duyên khởi có thể được hiểu như là "có nguồn gốc phụ thuộc nhau" hay "sự sinh khởi phụ thuộc lẫn nhau". Giáo lý này giải thích đồng thời bản chất sự tác động hỗ tương của những nguyên nhân và điều kiện (duyên) trên bình diện tương đối, thế tục của thực tại, cũng như bản chất của tánh Không - hay vô ngã - trên bình diện tối hậu của thực tại. Mặc dù cần phải có những nỗ lực tinh tấn trong thiền định và nội quán mới có thể đạt được sự chứng ngộ lý duyên sinh, nhưng một phương pháp như Mo giúp ta hé mở một thoáng nhìn về sự tương thuộc cùng với vai trò của nhân quả trong thế giới ta đang sống và hy vọng là có thể khơi dậy trong ta sự quán chiếu những điều đó ở một mức độ sâu xa hơn...</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #333333;"><strong>Mời các bạn đón đọc!</strong><br /></span></p>', '2011-01-14', 0, 152, 57, 4, 'NXB Tôn Giáo', 'null', 184, 1, 30000, 37000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/mo-pp-tien-tri-tay-tang.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Nó cần phải được nâng lên một bình diện khác cao hơn để mở rộng ra, nhìn mọi sự qua một nhãn quang mới. Chỉ có áp dụng cách đó việc chữa trị mới mang lại kết quả tốt đẹp được"</span><br /><br /><strong><span>Mục lục:</span></strong><br /><br /><span>Thần chết và đời sống</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tính nóng giận</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Sự nóng giận</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Quyền tức giận</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Sự gắn bó</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Nghịch cảnh</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Mặc cảm tội lỗi</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tính nôn nóng</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Ly nước đầy</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Kiềm chế, bộc lộ và dứt bỏ</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tính do dự</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Căn bệnh của trí não</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Sự ganh tỵ</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Số nhiều</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Trong tinh thần thiền định</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Tư tưởng và hành động</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>Giải thoát</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>...</span></p>', '2016-11-14', 0, 72, 1, 34, 'NXB Hồng Đức', 'null', NULL, 9, 64000, 80000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/minh-triet-trong-doi-song_2.u547.d20161118.t134053.146362.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Những bài viết của chị lần lượt được đăng tải trên Facebook bằng hai thứ tiếng: Việt và Anh (sau này chị dùng tiếng Việt là chủ yếu) đã nhận được sự đồng cảm và chia sẻ của rất nhiều người. Và ngày hôm nay, những câu chuyện mà tác giả <strong>Phoenix Ho</strong> gọi là “các đoạn văn ngắn” đã được thành hình bằng cuốn sách <strong>Mẹ dắt con đi</strong>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tên cuốn sách xuất phát từ câu ca dao về <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> vô bờ của mẹ, đã trở nên thân thuộc với mỗi người dân Việt: <em>“Ví dầu cầu ván đóng đinh. Cầu tre lắt lẻo gập ghềnh khó đi. Khó đi mẹ dắt con đi. Con đi trường học, mẹ đi trường đời”</em>. Vì lẽ đó, lật giở từng trang sách của <strong>Mẹ dắt con đi</strong>, bạn đọc sẽ gặp ở đây tấm lòng bao la của người mẹ trẻ với con mình. Người mẹ ấy không những mang nặng đẻ đau chín tháng mười ngày, mà còn tận tụy với con từ lúc con vừa được sinh ra, đến khi chập chững bước đi và bập bẹ cất lên những tiếng nói đầu tiên trong đời.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tác giả <strong>Phoenix</strong> không kể một mạch những câu chuyện về Gấu - tên thân mật của con trai chị, từ lúc sinh ra cho đến lúc cậu bé được 7 tuổi; mà chị phân chia thành 6 nhóm truyện theo các chủ đề khác nhau như: Gắn bó, Thỏ thẻ như trẻ lên ba, Nuôi dưỡng tùy cá tính tự nhiên, Kỷ luật dựa trên giá trị sống, Khi con qua 5 tuổi và Những khoảng lặng. Những câu chuyện trong cuốn sách này, được viết một cách mộc mạc, tự nhiên giống như chị đang ghi lại những khoảnh khắc trong cuộc sống của hai mẹ con, từ trong nhà ra đường phố, từ chuyện ăn ngủ đến chuyện cư xử với những người xung quanh… Ở đó, có những câu chuyện khiến chúng ta không khỏi bật cười vì sự hồn nhiên, ngây thơ của Gấu; nhưng cũng có những câu chuyện khiến chúng ta phải bùi ngùi xúc động trước tình thương bao la mà chị dành cho con trai của mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đến với cuốn sách <strong>Mẹ dắt con đi</strong> của tác giả <strong>Phoenix</strong>, bạn đọc càng thêm tin rằng: không ai yêu thương ta bằng mẹ. Bạn đọc sẽ đồng cảm với cảm giác lần đầu tiên làm mẹ của <strong>Phonenix Ho </strong>khi chị có những thương lo không biết giãi bày cùng ai:<em> “Cho dù làm mẹ tốt cách nào, lòng mẹ vẫn luôn canh cánh mình làm sai và sợ ảnh hưởng không tốt vào cuộc đời con sau này. Quá thông cảm ư? - Sau này con khó hài lòng với người khác. Quá cứng rắn ư? - Làm tổn thương con thì sao! Quá bảo vệ ư? - Rồi làm sao nó có thể tự lập khi trưởng thành”. Chị yêu con đến mức nhiều khi một biểu hiện gì đó khác thường ở con cũng khiến chị se thắt lòng, như khi phát hiện chiếc răng của con có một lỗ nhỏ, là dấu hiệu của sâu răng. Yêu con là vậy, nhưng Phoenix Ho cũng rất nghiêm khắc trong việc dạy dỗ con. Dù rất khó nhưng chị vẫn cố gắng để con trai mình hiểu rằng “yêu thương giữa cha mẹ và con cái phải có hai chiều”. Bởi theo chị, mục đích là để “tránh tình trạng con lớn lên khư khư trong tâm trí rằng cha mẹ thương mình là chuyện đương nhiên, còn ngược lại thì không hề có”</em>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bạn đọc sẽ còn tìm thấy ở <strong>Mẹ dắt con đi</strong> những bài học và kinh nghiệm bổ ích trong việc dạy con, được tác giả <strong>Phoenix Ho</strong> chắt lọc từ rất nhiều tài liệu tin cậy cũng như từ trải nghiệm bản thân của lần đầu tiên làm mẹ. Đặc biệt là cách chị vượt qua khó khăn của giai đoạn làm mẹ đơn thân để yêu thương con, không để con phải thiếu thốn về tình cảm. Và giờ đây, khi đã vượt qua rất nhiều khó khăn của lần đầu làm mẹ, để chứng kiến con từng bước trưởng thành, chị cảm thấy rõ hơn về vai trò thiêng liêng của mình:<em> “Đến ngày hôm nay tôi mới tự tin rằng mình sẽ làm tốt vai trò này. Tôi cảm thấy hãnh diện vì những gì mình đã đạt được và tôi tin mình sẽ còn tiếp tục học hỏi được thật nhiều mỗi ngày trong cuộc hành trình nuôi dạy con dài đằng đẵng này”</em>.</p>', '2015-05-14', 0, 331, 1, 36, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', 229, 7, 54000, 68000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img963_2.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Lý Quang Diệu (Lee Kuan Yew) là một chính khách đặc biệt, độc nhất vô nhị trong nửa thế kỷ qua. Là “cha đẻ” và là nhân vật rất có ảnh hưởng ở Singapore trong hơn năm thập kỷ, ông tiếp quản một thành bang nghèo nàn, tham nhũng để xây dựng thành một quốc gia hiện đại nơi người dân hiện có thu nhập cao hơn cả phần lớn người dân Mỹ. Không chỉ với vai trò một nhà tư tưởng mà còn là người tiên phong hành động, ông rất hiểu vấn đề chuyển đổi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong các vấn đề quốc tế, không có bất kỳ nhân vật nào được cả một thế hệ các nhà lãnh đạo Mỹ, Trung Quốc và thế giới háo hức “săn lùng”, thường xuyên tham khảo ý kiến, và chăm chú lắng nghe bằng “nhà hiền triết” của Singapore.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Không chỉ có các cường quốc mà cả những nước nhỏ hơn như Israel, quốc gia luôn phải chú ý tới những xu hướng ở bên ngoài biên giới của mình để bảo đảm sự tồn tại, cũng tìm thấy ở Lý Quang Diệu cả một nguồn viễn kiến và cảm hứng. Từ Nursultan Nazarbayev của Kazakhstan, khi trở thành người đứng đầu của một đất nước mới độc lập vốn chưa từng tồn tại, đến Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed của các Tiểu vương quốc Ả-rập, đến Paul Kagame của Rwanda, và rất nhiều nhà lãnh đạo khác khi gặp thách thức lớn cũng đã tìm thấy ở Lý Quang Diệu sự hợp tác chiến lược giúp họ tìm cách vượt qua những thách thức quốc tế đó.Mục đích của cuốn sách mỏng này không phải để nhìn lại 50 năm qua với những đóng góp nổi bật của Lý Quang Diệu. Mười chương sách bắt đầu với sự trỗi dậy của Trung Quốc, vấn đề mà chắc chắn Lý Quang Diệu hiểu rõ hơn bất kỳ nhà quan sát hay nhà phân tích nào ở bên ngoài Trung Quốc. Liệu Trung Quốc có thách thức vị thế của Hoa Kỳ là cường quốc đứng đầu ở châu Á và trên toàn thế giới hay không? Hầu hết các nhà hoạch định chính sách và các chuyên gia đều trả lời câu hỏi trọng tâm này một cách hoang mang và trừu tượng. Bỏ qua những từ ngữ hoa mỹ và thận trọng, Lý Quang Diệu trả lời: “Tất nhiên, nhận thức của người Trung Quốc về vận mệnh là một sức mạnh không cưỡng lại được. Ý định của Trung Quốc là trở thành cường quốc mạnh nhất thế gới – và phải được công nhận với tư cách Trung Quốc, chứ không phải là một thành viên danh dự của phương Tây.”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tiếp đến, là cuộc phỏng vấn về Hoa Kỳ và mối quan hệ Mỹ-Trung, mối quan hệ sẽ định hình chính trị quốc tế trong thế kỷ 21. Giữa hai cường quốc này, ông Lý nhận thấy có sự đối đầu: “Sẽ có sự tranh giành ảnh hưởng. Sự cạnh tranh giữa hai cường quốc là điều không thể tránh khỏi.” Tuy nhiên, ngược với những nhà duy thực bi quan, ông không đánh giá xung đột là điều không thể tránh khỏi nếu các nhà lãnh đạo của hai nước có các quyết định hợp lý.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Các chương sách tiếp theo nói đến Ấn Độ, chủ nghĩa cực đoan Hồi giáo, địa chính trị, toàn cầu hóa, dân chủ, và các chủ đề khác. Mỗi chương đều mở đầu với các câu hỏi then chốt và sau đó đưa ra một tóm tắt ngắn gọn các câu trả lời của Lý Quang Diệu. Nhiều câu trả lời trong số này sẽ gây tranh cãi vì bẩm sinh Lý Quang Diệu luôn thúc đẩy thực hiện “sự chính xác chính trị” và không bao giờ e ngại tranh luận.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách để lại cho người đọc nhiều suy nghỉ, những ai hy vọng nhanh chóng bứt phá thông qua quyển sách này sẽ nhận thấy chính họ phải bỏ ra nhiều thời gian hơn họ mong đợi. Những lời nói của Lý Quang Diệu buộc họ phải dừng lại và suy nghĩ về những nhận định của ông ấy, nhưng điều họ thấy kinh ngạc, thậm chí gây nhiễu loạn, nhưng lại luôn có khả năng soi rọi.<span style="font-size: medium; color: #008000;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>', '2013-08-14', 0, 291, 16, 31, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 266, 9, 55000, 69000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/ly-quang-dieu.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Ông vẫn tiếp tục giữ chức Bộ trưởng Cao cấp trong Chính phủ của Thủ tướng Ngô Tác Đống và Bộ trưởng Cố vấn dưới quyền lãnh đạo của con trai ông _ Lý Hiển Long.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuốn sách này, Lý Quang Diệu thể hiện niềm tin kiên định của mình bằng nhiều hình thức khác nhau. Ước mơ và quan niệm một đời của ông không hề dao động, ông tin rằng Singapore cần được lãnh đạo bởi một “chính quyền lớn mạnh”, kinh tế phát triển mới có thể khiến tự do được phát triển.

Để làm được dạng đề này ngoài việc học sinh hiểu đề còn phải biết phân tích đề để có chính kiến rõ ràng hoặc đồng ý hoặc không đồng ý, hay chỉ đồng ý một phần nào đó, phải biết cách lập luận và trình bày quan điểm của mình một cách mạch lạc, chặt chẽ. Muốn được như vậy học sinh cần được trang bị một số kiến thức xã hội nhất định. Một khi đã có quan điểm, lập trường, nhận thức riêng, các em dễ dàng bày tỏ quan điểm của mình về vấn đề được đặt ra trong đề bài, không viết a dua, sáo rỗng hoặc theo một sự định hướng cụ thể nào đó.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Quyển sách này bao gồm đề bài, dàn bài chi tiết theo từng chuyên đề nhằm cung cấp một số kiến thức nền nhất định để các em có nền tảng thỏa sức sáng tạo, nâng cao tầm nhận thức tư duy và rèn kỹ năng viết văn nghị luận. <br /><br /><br /></p>', '2016-05-14', 0, 388, 33, 4, 'NXB Thanh Niên', 'null', 327, 1, 84500, 169000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/139727756964.u335.d20160520.t093247.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Qua tiếp xúc, tác giả từ ngạc nhiên đến tò mò bởi chàng trai này giao tiếp tiếng Anh thành thạo như một người bản ngữ, thậm chí khó tìm thấy được dấu hiệu tiếng Anh là chỉ là ngoại ngữ đối với chàng trai này. Tác giả đã rất tò mò, bởi có thể nói tiếng Anh như người bản ngữ như anh chàng này không nhiều. Câu trả lời của Shimon Yakir khiến tác giả rất bất ngờ: “ở Israel mọi người đều nói tiếng Do Thái và tiếng Ả- Rập là ngôn ngữ chính thức, nhưng hầu hết dân Israel đều nói tốt tiếng Anh và tiếng Đức, đấy còn chưa kể không ít người dùng tốt tới bốn hay có thể là năm ngôn ngữ khác nhau.”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tại sao người Do Thái vẫn nói được tiếng Do Thái cổ của 2000 năm trước dù hàng nghìn thế hệ đã phải lưu vong, rồi sinh ra và chết đi ở nơi đất khách quê người?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tại sao người Do Thái học và nói được nhiều ngoại ngữ một cách nhanh chóng và dễ dàng đến vậy? Và tại sao những đứa trẻ Do Thái lại có thể nói tới hai ba ngôn ngữ khác nhau một các tự nhiên và đơn giản như thế? Những câu hỏi như vậy luôn bao quanh suy nghĩ của tác giả, đã thôi thúc ông nghiên cứu và tìm hiểu về phương pháp học ngoại ngữ hiệu quả của dân tộc Do Thái.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ông mong muốn có thể truyền tải một cách đơn giản nhất cách mà người Do Thái học một ngôn ngữ mới thú vị thế nào, nó đầy sức mạnh tư duy và nhiều năng lượng sống tới người học tiếng Anh Việt Nam đang cảm thấy tiếng Anh luôn là áp lực. Chính tiếng Anh hiện nay đã cản trở vô số công việc thăng tiến và hạnh phúc của các bạn trẻ Việt.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuối cùng, tác giả đã khám phá ra bí mật học ngoại ngữ của dân tộc thông minh nhất Thế giới. Họ sử dụng các học khá đơn giản: đó là trộn tiếng mẹ đẻ với ngôn ngữ mới và họ muốn học. Điều này giúp ngôn ngữ mới không còn xa lạ nữa, luôn có cảm giác tò mò chủ động tìm hiểu ngôn ngữ mới đó như thế nào? Cách học này thực ra rất đơn giản và bất cứ ai cũng có thể áp dụng được, tác giả tin rằng người Việt Nam chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể làm được, thậm chí là thành công hơn thế!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Những điều không tưởng trước đây như học thuộc và nhớ lâu 100 từ vựng tiếng Anh mới mỗi ngày là điều không thể thì nay hoàn toàn có thể với phương pháp học tự tìm ra tính chủ động của bản thân này.</p>  <p><span>Để giúp người học có thể hình dung cho mình được phương pháp học hiệu quả này, tác giả đặc biệt dành tặng mỗi cuốn sách <strong>1 THẺ HỌC TRỰC TUYẾN CỦA SMARTCOM TRỊ GIÁ 150.000 ĐỒNG</strong>.</span></p>  <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://tikicdn.com/media/catalog/product/t/h/the_hoc_tieng_anh_smartcom_3_1.png" alt="https://tikicdn.com/media/catalog/product/t/h/the_hoc_tieng_anh_smartcom_3_1.png" width="768" height="446" /></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách được trình bày đưới dạng 13 chuyên đề tương ứng với 13 bí mật học ngoại ngữ của người Do Thái.

Và để giúp người học áp dụng triệt để cuốn sách vào thực tiễn, tác giả đã áp dụng triệt để phương pháp học hiệu quả này vào nền tảng các chuyên đề của bài thi TOEIC.

Chuyện kể về cuộc tranh cãi, và cả… tranh giành, của nhóc Nicolas và đám bạn về chuyện làm một tờ báo, khi một hôm thằng Maixent đem vô lớp bộ đồ in. Tranh cãi từ việc đặt tên cho tờ báo, cho tới chuyện in gì ở trong báo, báo in ra rồi thì phải làm gì, bán cho ai, ai là người bán, rồi ai là chủ nhiệm, rồi thì…  các nhóc đánh nhau, “bộ đồ in rơi tung toé hết ra đất”, rồi thầy Nước Lèo tịch thu bộ đồ in.</p>  <div id="attachment_2561" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 434px;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-2561" href="http://www.luckylukefc.com/daily-star-mot-cau-chuyen-hay-ve-nghe-bao/nhoc-nicolas-lam-bao/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2561" title="Nhóc Nicolas_Làm báo" src="http://www.luckylukefc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Nhoc-Nicolas_Lam-bao1.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="293" /></a>  <p class="wp-caption-text">Minh hoạ của Sempé, trích tập "Giờ ra chơi của nhóc Nicolas".</p>  </div>  <p>Chương này kết thúc với đoạn: <em>“… Còn tờ báo thì chúng tôi chẳng ra được. Thầy Nước Lèo không muốn trả lại cho chúng tôi bô đồ in trước kỳ nghỉ hè. Xời! Đằng nào thì chúng tôi cũng chẳng có gì để mà kể trên báo cả. <strong>Chỗ chúng tôi chẳng bao giờ xảy ra chuyện gì</strong>.”</em></p>  <p>Với bốn tranh minh hoạ của Sempé, chín trang chuyện trên của ông Goscinny thật ra đã lồng hết những vấn đề căn bản của nghề báo vô những câu chuyện trẻ con dễ thương, bên trong cái vỏ ngoài ngây ngô là cả những bí quyết làm báo. Và hẳn các bạn đã nhận ra: khi nhóc Nicolas kết luận rằng <em>“chẳng có gì để mà kể trên báo”, </em>và <em>“chỗ chúng tôi chẳng bao giờ xảy ra chuyện gì” </em>thì người lớn, dù chẳng là nhà báo, đều <strong><em>nghĩ ngược lại </em></strong>với nhóc ta!</p>  <p>Đó chính là <strong><em>bàn tay của bậc thầy</em></strong>: Nói về nghề báo qua câu chuyện của bọn nhóc. Tưng tửng <em>theo cách kể chuyện của một đứa trẻ con</em> (<em>“nghĩa là không phải bắt chước trẻ con”</em> – lời Goscinny) để bạn đọc trẻ con và cả người lớn tự rút ra những kết luận, và “bài học”, có thể ngược hẳn với lời kể của nhóc Nicolas. Dụng ý nằm ở đó, nghệ thuật và cái hóm hỉnh, sâu sắc cũng nằm ở đó, khác hẳn phong cách “luân lý giáo khoa thư” ở ta!</p>  <p>Nguyên tác <em>Giờ ra chơi của nhóc Nicolas (Les récrés du petit Nicolas)</em> ra đời năm 1961. Liệu hai ông Fauche và Léturgie có tìm cảm hứng, và cả cách kể chuyện về nghề báo, từ chương này của Goscinny để vận dụng vô tập <em>Daily Star </em>(phát hành năm 1984)?</p>  <p>Có một “dấu vết” khá rõ trong <em>Daily Star</em>, ở trang 11, khi các tác giả cho anh chàng Horace Greely ngây ngô đi rao báo với những đề tài lạ hoác, thậm chí còn ngược lại hẳn với sự quan tâm của từng nhóm người ở Dead End City. Vì vậy, ở khung tranh áp chót của trang này, các tác giả đã cho Lucky Luke khuyên chàng Greely: <strong><em>“Anh phải nói tới những gì khiến mọi người phải quan tâm.”</em> </strong>Đoạn này gần như “đi song đôi” với những tranh cãi của bọn nhóc về <strong><em>chuyện in gì ở trong báo</em></strong>, và <strong><em>bán báo cho ai</em></strong>, trong tập <em>Nhóc Nicolas</em> vừa nhắc tới.</p>  <p><strong>VÌ SAO LÀ “SIÊU BÁO”?</strong></p>  <p>Dễ nhận ra trước hết trong tập <em>Daily Star </em>là những yếu tố sống chết của báo in, thông qua mô-típ lặp đi lặp lại (như ở truyện cổ tích, từ <em>“Nói đến báo là nói đến giấy, mà hễ không có giấy tức là không có báo”, </em>rồi<em>… đến <a href="http://tiki.vn/muc-in/c4532">mực in</a>…</em>) để giúp bạn đọc, nhất là… trẻ em, hiểu được cái cốt lõi của nghề này một cách nhẹ nhàng, đầy lôi cuốn:</p>  <div id="attachment_2562" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 457px;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-2562" href="http://www.luckylukefc.com/daily-star-mot-cau-chuyen-hay-ve-nghe-bao/lucky-luke-daily-star-08/"><img class="size-full wp-image-2562" title="Lucky Luke_Daily Star 08" src="http://www.luckylukefc.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Lucky-Luke_Daily-Star-081.jpg" alt="" width="447" height="212" /></a>  <p class="wp-caption-text">Khi Lucky Luke và cả Jolly Jumper tham gia làm báo...</p>  </div>  <p>- Làm báo in, phải cần <strong><em>giấy</em></strong>, cần <strong><em>mực in</em></strong>, cần <strong><em>người phát hành</em></strong> (và hệ thống phát hành, gồm cả loại hình nhận đặt báo dài hạn, phát tận nhà), cần cả <strong><em>sự đúng hẹn </em></strong>(lịch ra báo), để <strong><em>giữ đúng cam kết về tôn chỉ của tờ báo</em></strong>, và cam kết với bạn đọc;</p>  <p>- Phát triển nhờ <strong><em>bám sát nhu cầu thật của những người đọc cụ thể;</em></strong></p>  <p>- Làm báo thì cần <strong><em>nói thẳng sự thật</em></strong>, và chấp nhận <strong><em>cạnh tranh báo chí</em></strong>, kể cả chống loại<em> báo lá cải</em> (và vì vậy cũng cần.có sự hỗ trợ từ pháp lý, hay công lý, như vai trò “bảo hộ” của… Lucky Luke);</p>  <p>Đặc biệt, bây giờ đọc lại cái tình huống Greely quá hồn nhi&ececirc;n khi tường thuật cả kế hoạch sắp tấn công của Lucky Luke, do các tác giả khéo bịa ra hồi năm 1984 mà… giật mình.

Theo truyền thuyết về Calamity Jane, cha mẹ cô đã chết dọc đường, nên Jane đã cùng năm đứa em phải nương nhờ vào các gia đình khác để tiếp tục cuộc hành trình. Lúc ấy, Jane 11 tuổi. Cuộc đời mới mở ra như vậy là quá khắc nghiệt với cô, nên cái biệt hiệu Calamity Jane (tức nàng Jane Tai Hoạ) ra đời từ hồi ấy…</p>  <p>Tuy vậy, cuốn tự truyện của Calamity Jane lại kể khác hơn: Năm 1865, gia đình cô chuyển về Montana. Trên đường đi, Jane đã cỡi ngựa theo những người đàn ông đi săn vào những lúc đoàn xe tạm nghỉ dọc đường. Đối với một cô bé mà từ nhỏ đã rất thích phiêu lưu, thích hoạt động ngoài trời và mê ngựa thì như vậy quả thật là… thoả chí. Mẹ của cô chết khi đến Black Foot (Montana, năm 1866), còn lúc đến Utah thì bố cô mới qua đời (1867)…</p>  <p>Một câu chuyện khác lại cho biết bố mẹ của Jane chỉ chết khi đã đến một thị trấn khai thác vàng ở gần Virginia City. Do đó, Jane đã phải kiếm sống bằng các việc vặt. Nào rửa chén, nào nấu bếp, rồi… đánh xe ngựa, hoặc thậm chí còn tham gia… lột da lừa để kiếm thêm tiền!</p>  <p>Với một cô gái trẻ sớm phải bước vào đời như vậy, việc phải cứng rắn hơn một chút, kể cả phải… đánh nhau và học sử dụng súng, đều là những chuyện có thể… thông cảm được, dưới con mắt dân cao bồi.</p>  <p>Cùng vì vậy, theo chuyện này, đến năm 18 tuổi thì Calamity Jane đã cao lớn, rắn chắc và dẻo dai như nam giới. Người ta thấy vậy, còn gọi luôn Jane là cô “Xương Lớn”!</p>  <p><strong>CẮT TÓC, GIẢ TRAI</strong></p>  <p>Có vẻ tất cả những lời kể về Calamity Jane đều gặp nhau ở mấy điểm sau: đó là một kỵ sĩ giỏi, bắn súng rất tài. Song cô ta cũng rất thích… vào quán rượu và nốc rượu chẳng kém ai, thích đánh bài nhưng chơi bài dở tệ, thích nhai… thuốc lá và cũng không ngại… chửi bậy!

Ban đầu, Lucky Luke luôn xuất hiện với điếu thuốc lá trên môi, nhưng về sau để tránh hình ảnh người hùng nghiện thuốc lá, Morris cho thay thế bằng một cọng cỏ. Xử lý các tình huống một cách hài hước thông minh, cộng với tài bắn súng và sự may mắn, Lucky Luke luôn thành công ở cuối mỗi tập truyện.<br /><br />Đồng hành với Lucky Luke là Jolly Jumper, chú ngựa chạy nhanh nhất miền Tây. Là con ngựa đặc biệt, Jolly Jumper biết đi trên dây, thông minh tới mức cùng chơi cờ với Lucky Luke và khi nói truyện có thể trính dẫn cả văn học. Jolly Jumper nhiều lần cứu Lucky Luke thoát khỏi các tình huống khó khăn nhưng hai nhân vật này thương xuyên trêu trọc nhau. Như trong tập Nàng Sarah Bernhardt, Jolly Jumper chê bai vì Lucky Luke soi gương trước khi đi gặp Sarah Bernhardt, còn Lucky Luke trêu rằng Jolly Jumper không mặc gì khi chú ngựa này không đeo yên.

Tác phẩm cùng bộ nhưng lại mang một phong cách hoàn toàn khác với 2 cuốn sách được hàng chục ngàn chị em sở hữu - <strong><em>Anh Sẽ cưới em thêm nhiều lần nữa</em></strong> và <strong><em>Em muốn có một cuộc tình già với anh</em></strong>. Đúng như những bật mí của nhà văn Hoàng Anh Tú, cuốn sách không hẳn là một cuốn tản văn mà phần nhiều là những bài viết chia sẻ "kỹ năng" nuôi dưỡng hôn nhân, là một cuốn cẩm nang để làm mới, để thắp lửa cho những cuộc hôn nhân.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Một ngôi nhà xây 5,7 năm rồi cũng sẽ xuống cấp, sẽ hỏng hóc và cần phải sửa sang và mái ấm gia đình cũng vậy, cuộc hôn nhân nào trải qua thời gian cũng cần được sang sửa và làm mới. Có lỗi không nếu người vợ cảm thấy phát ngán với một cuộc hôn nhân nhàm chán, đều đặn; có tệ không nếu người chồng cạn cảm xúc yêu thương trong một cuộc hôn nhân đã "chết lâm sàng". Người ta than phiền vì hôn nhân không <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a>, vì người chồng, người vợ của mình khác với khi yêu nhau nhiều quá. Chẳng còn hẹn hò, chẳng còn háo hức, không thấy yêu thương dạt dào hay hồi hộp chờ đợi những nụ hôn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Xin đừng vội đổ lỗi cho nửa kia khi mình không tự thay đổi và không tự "sốc" lại tình cảm hôn nhân của mình. Thay vì tìm kiếm những điều mới mẻ, "lạ miệng" trong cuộc ngoại tình với người thứ ba, tại sao các cặp vợ chồng không học cách hâm nóng hôn nhân của mình, tìm cách ngoại tình với chính... chồng/vợ mình? Và suy nghĩ "chẳng giống ai" ấy của nhà văn Hoàng Anh Tú đã được hiện thực hóa bằng cuốn sách mang tựa đề: LÀM THẾ NÀO ĐỂ NGOẠI TÌNH VỚI... CHỒNG!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Có 2 phiên bản cùng lúc phát hành trong dịp này. Phiên bản thường dành cho những ai lần đầu tiên đọc thử, muốn đọc thử xem "cái gã" Hoàng Anh Tú này viết cái gì.

Và thế là cả hai chúng tôi đã trở thành người mắc nợ lẫn nhau. Và tôi thì trong suốt cuộc đời mình, cho đến hôm nay, từ sâu thẳm trái tim mình không muốn mắc nợ ai!

Đó là LỬA (ánh sáng mặt trời) là KHÔNG KHÍ, là ĐẤT và NƯỚC. Tác giả cũng đã khẳng định (ngay trong cuốn sách) là cứ qua mỗi 10 ngày một, khi cơ thể được nuôi dưỡng đúng sẽ nhận được máu mới hoàn toàn tốt, và cơ thể sẽ tự động điều chỉnh đáng kể về sức khỏe theo hướng tích cực. Các chỉ dẫn của ông rất rõ ràng, dễ hiểu. Các nguồn thức ăn mà ông giới thiệu đâu có đắt đỏ và khó kiếm tìm trong thực tế đời sống của chúng ta.

Giờ đây, trong cuốn <strong>Lẽ Phải Của  Phi Lý Trí,</strong> ông hé lộ những ảnh hưởng đầy bất ngờ, cả tích cực lẫn tiêu cực, mà "phi lý trí"có thể tác động đến cuộc sống của chúng ta. Tập trung vào nghiên cứu những hành vi của chúng ta tại nơi làm việc và các mối quan hệ của chúng ta, ông đưa ra những hiểu biết mới và những sự thật đáng ngạc nhiên về những điều đang thôi thúc chúng ta làm việc, cách thức mà một hành động thiếu khôn ngoan có thể trở thành một thói quen, cách mà chúng ta học để yêu thương những người mà chúng ta sống cùng, và còn nhiều hơn thế nữa.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Sử dụng những phương pháp thí nghiệm giống như những gì đã khiến cuốn sách <strong><em>Phi Lý Trí</em></strong> trở thành một trong những cuốn sách được bàn luận tới nhiều nhất trong vài năm trở lại đây, Ariely sử dụng dữ liệu từ những thí nghiệm thú vị và độc đáo để đưa ra những kết luận hấp dẫn về cách thức - và nguyên nhân tại sao - chúng ta hành động như vậy. Từ những thái độ tại nơi làm việc của chúng ta, cho tới những mối quan hệ lãng mạn, tới việc chúng ta luôn tìm kiếm mục đích cuộc đời mình, Ariely lý giải cách thức phá vỡ những khuôn mẫu bi quan trong suy nghĩ và hành vi của chúng ta để đưa ra những quyết định tốt hơn. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><em>Lẽ Phải Của Phi Lý Trí</em></strong> sẽ thay đổi cách thức chúng ta nhận thức bản thân trong công việc và trong gia đình - và soi xét các hành vi phi lý trí của chúng ta dưới một thứ sắc thái ánh sáng hoàn toàn mới mẻ.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Đọc cuốn sách bạn sẽ biết:</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">- Tại sao những khoản tiền thưởng lớn lại có thể khiến các CEO làm việc kém hiệu quả hơn?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">- Làm cách nào mà những định hướng rối rắm lại hữu ích đối với chúng ta?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">- Tại sao việc trả thù lại quan trọng?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">- Tại sao có một sự khác biệt rất lớn giữa điều mà chúng ta nghĩ là sẽ khiến chúng ta hạnh phúc và những thứ thực sự khiến chúng ta hạnh phúc?</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Và rất nhiều phát hiện thú vị khác...</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><em>“Dan Ariely là một thiên tài trong việc am hiểu hành vi con người: không một nhà kinh tế nào có thể giỏi hơn ông trong việc lột trần và lý giải những nguyên nhân ẩn sâu phía sau những hành động kỳ quặc của con người.”</em></strong> -<em> James Surowiecki, tác giả cuốn Trí Tuệ Đám Đông.</em></span></p>  <div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;">Mời các bạn đón đọc!</span></div>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span><br /></span></p>', '2013-05-14', 0, 63, 9, 25, 'NXB Thời Đại', 'null', 410, 0, 87000, 109000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/002_4_7.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Lịch sử thư pháp Việt Nam dẫu không huy hoàng nhưng cũng không hề thiếu những điểm sáng chói. Tuy vậy từ trước tới giờ nghiên cứu về thư pháp vẫn đang là một mảng trống trong lịch sử chưa ai khai phá.<br /><br />Cuốn sách này là quá trình khảo cứu công phu các sử liệu Việt Nam cùng với sử liệu Trung Quốc, Nhật Bản, Hàn Quốc bàn về thư pháp, khảo sát và đối chiếu một hệ thống các tác phẩm thư pháp Việt Nam suốt chiều dài lịch sử hiện còn lưu giữ trong các đền chùa, trên bia đá, vách núi, hang động hay trên giấy. Ở hai triều đại Lý, Trần, nền thư pháp Đại Việt đã phát triển đến độ cực thịnh, ở mỗi thể chữ triện, hành, thảo, lệ… đều có tác phẩm đỉnh cao. Nhà Lê trải hơn 20 năm biến loạn vẫn giữ gìn được nền tảng cũ, đồng thời hình thành lối chữ hoa áp - một phong cách chữ đặc thù thống lĩnh thư đàn nước Việt. Thời Nguyễn lại xuất hiện hàng loạt các thư gia, mỗi người một lối biểu đạt khác nhau khiến cho thư đàn vô cùng sôi động…<br /><br />Với công trình này, lần đầu tiên, nhà nghiên cứu Nguyễn Sử đã xác lập một diện mạo toàn vẹn nhất cho lịch sử thư pháp Việt Nam.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: medium;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>', '2017-02-14', 0, 274, 17, 11, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 285, 8, 135200, 169000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/lich-su-thu-phap-viet-nam-01.u2487.d20170206.t145540.601556.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Nếu đi du lịch theo đoàn thì đến buổi tối, hướng dẫn viên du lịch sẽ dẫn đoàn đến Nhà hát kịch lớn Trường An nằm trên đường Trường An (con đường chủ đạo bắc ngang hướng đông và tây của Bắc Kinh).</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hội trường của nhà hát kịch được trang hoàng lộng lẫy, có các tủ kiếng bán đồ thủ công mỹ nghệ dân gian, có thể mua được các kiểm phổ (dịch nghĩa: mặt nạ) Kinh kịch và các sách giới thiệu về <strong>Kinh kịch Trung Quốc</strong>, các tác phẩm hội họa, đĩa nhạc và đĩa hình...; dàn loa của hội trường phát ra các phân đoạn ca khúc Kinh kịch, dù rằng không biết đó là kịch gì, nhưng giai điệu du dương, quyến rũ đó lại vô cùng mê hồn. Trong nhà hát, sân khấu được thiết kế theo phong cách phương Tây, những hàng ghế ở giữa và phía sau là những chiếc ghế sô pha mềm mại, nhưng các hàng ghế trước lại là những chiếc bàn Bát Tiên và ghế Thái Sư bằng gỗ, phong cách cổ điển dường như trở thành điểm nhấn mang tính tượng trưng ở đây. Sau khi kiếm được chỗ ngồi, quan sát các khán giả kịch ở xung quanh - biểu hiện trên gương mặt họ đều tỏ ra rất thư thái, nhẹ nhõm, không trau chuốt trong phong cách ăn mặc - trước khi bắt đầu biểu diễn có rất nhiều người nghiêng người to nhỏ nói chuyện với nhau, nhưng chỉ cần tiếng trống và chiêng vang lên thì mọi người liền im lặng, tập trung tinh thần xem biểu diễn, đắm mình vào trong diễn biến của các tình tiết trong vở kịch, ai nấy dường như đều biết trước khi nào sẽ có nhân vật nào lên sân khấu, và cũng biết rõ khi nào phải vỗ tay tán thưởng tài nghệ biểu diễn của diễn viên nào. Ngạc nhiên hơn nữa là cách thức biểu thị sự tán thưởng và khích lệ nồng nhiệt của người Trung Quốc đối với tài diễn xuất của diễn viên - bên cạnh việc vỗ tay còn la to lên “ao”! Sau khi hỏi người phiên dịch mới biết từ này có nghĩa là reo hò cổ vũ và khen thưởng khích lệ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Người nước ngoài lần đầu tiên xem Kinh kịch đều cảm thấy Kinh kịch có khoảng cách rất xa vời và khó tiếp cận, nghe không hiểu và xem cũng không hiểu. Thực ra, nói gì đến người nước ngoài, ngay cả người Trung Quốc ngày nay cũng khó mà tiếp cận với Kinh kịch. Tuy nhiên chỉ cần chịu khó tìm tòi, nghiên cứu các đặc điểm nghệ thuật và nội dung văn hóa bên trong của Kinh kịch, thì bạn phát hiện mọi thứ đều rất thi vị, không chừng khi đó, chỉ cần mỗi buổi sáng văng vẳng bên tai là những lời hát ê a, bạn sẽ phát hiện ra mình đã yêu bộ môn nghệ thuật này rồi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tuy rằng thời điểm ra đời của Kinh kịch chỉ cách nay không lâu, nhưng đối với người phương Tây mà nói thì Kinh kịch lại mang vẻ bí ẩn. Kinh kịch cắm rễ sâu trong lớp đất màu mỡ của nền văn hóa phương Đông, hoàn toàn khác biệt với hí kịch của phương Tây. Nếu bạn từng đến xem biểu diễn Kinh kịch ở Hội quán Hồ Quảng của khu Thành Nam Bắc Kinh hoặc ở Nhà hát kịch Chính Ất Tự thì sẽ có cảm nhận khác hẳn. Đối với những du khách nước ngoài mới đến Trung Quốc, phong cách cổ điển của hai nhà hát kịch này chính là một di tích văn hóa dân tộc để tìm hiểu Bắc Kinh nhiều hơn - hai nơi này vốn là địa chỉ cũ của Hội Kinh kịch cận đại - phong cách kiến trúc Trung Quốc truyền thống, những vật trang trí trong nhà hát đều mang dáng dấp cổ điển.

Chính vì thế, <strong>Coloring Book</strong> đã nhanh chóng trở thành sự lựa chọn của độc giả ở mọi lứa tuổi, như một hình thức giải trí mới lành mạnh, tăng cường sự tập trung và khẳng định cá tính.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu như đến với <strong>Khu vườn bí mật</strong>, chúng ta được trải nghiệm cuộc sống của một người trồng vườn trong khung cảnh thiên nhiên tuyệt đẹp, thì<strong> Khu rừng bị phù phép</strong> lại là một cuộc hành trình truy tìm kho báu. Bộ sách gồm hơn 120 bức vẽ với nguồn cảm hứng được hình thành từ chính khu rừng bao quanh nhà ông bà Johanna ở Ayshire hoang dã. Ban đầu, chúng chỉ là những nét vẽ đơn thuần trên nền giấy trắng, nhưng với chiếc bút chì màu chúng ta sẽ  “phù phép” cho những bức tranh vô hồn trở nên đẹp và cá tính.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Như một tấm bản đồ, bức tranh đầu tiên chính là chìa khóa cho hành trình truy tìm kho báu. Những mê cung, những cánh cổng, những tòa lâu đài đầy ma mị hứa hẹn sẽ mang đến trải nghiệm tuyệt vời cho mỗi người qua từng gam màu sáng tạo. Dọc trên hành trình khám phá, chúng ta sẽ bắt gặp những loài vật sống ở núi rừng. Đó là những chú cú mèo, những chú sóc mang trên mình họa tiết của cỏ cây, đầy nghệ thuật và thật tinh tế. Hãy thử tưởng tượng, một chú cáo với sắc màu rực rỡ của muôn hoa, nó sẽ không còn là một con dã thú mà trở nên thật đẹp và đáng yêu. Hay những chú hươu với chiếc sừng được cách điệu nhẹ nhàng, uốn lượn; trở thành chỗ nghỉ chân của bầy chim sau mỗi chuyến bay dài.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đặc biệt, điểm thu hút và ấn tượng nhất của bộ sách chính là những tòa lâu đài ẩn sâu sau vách đá. Đó có thể là nơi ở của những hoàng tử, công chúa nếu bạn tô vẽ bằng gam màu tươi vui, rực rỡ. Hay cũng có thể là nhà của mụ phù thủy đáng sợ với gam màu trầm tối, âm u… Chỉ với chiếc chì màu, các bạn có thể vẽ nên những câu chuyện cổ tích theo cách riêng của mình. Mỗi bức tranh là một chặng đường lý thú, chứa nhiều kho báu - mà báu vật lớn nhất chúng ta có được chính là sự thư giãn và sáng tạo.

Em nghèo khổ, em cô độc, em không có người thân. Cuộc đời Rêmi gắn liền với gánh xiếc rong, với những thử thách mà em gặp phải trên đường đời trải rộng khắp nước Pháp tươi đẹp. Rêmi lớn lên trong đau khổ, lang thang mọi nơi, bị tù đày... nhưng dù trong hoàn cảnh nào, em vẫn đứng thẳng lưng, ngẩng cao đầu, giữ phẩm chất làm người - điều em đã học từ cụ Vitali trong cuộc đời lang bạt của mình. </span></p>  <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Không Gia Đình</strong> ca ngợi giá trị của lao động, của nhân cách và tình cảm.

Em bé Rêmi ấy đã lớn lên trong gian khổ. Em đã chung đụng với mọi hạng người, sống khắp mọi nơi, "nơi thì lừa đảo, nơi thì xót thương". Em đã lao động mà sống, lúc đầu dưới quyền điều khiển của một ông già từng trải và đạo đức, cụ Vitali, về sau thì tự lập và không những lo cho mình, còn bảo đảm việc biểu diễn và sinh sống cho cả một gánh hát rong. Đã có khi em và cả đoàn lang thang mấy hôm liền không có chút gì trong bụng. Đã có khi em suýt chết rét. Đã có khi em bị lụt ngầm chôn trong giếng mỏ mười mấy ngày đêm.

Khi yêu, ta vẫn xem như thể người đó chính là mảnh ghép còn thiếu trong cuộc đời của mình.Và tin rằng, đó chính là người mình cần, là người không thể thiếu trong cuộc đời, cho đến khi họ quay lưng bước đi, mới biết: "Người đã từng như đã là mảnh ghép bức tranh của mình thì cũng có thể sẽ là mảnh ghép trong bức tranh của người khác". Và tình yêu giống như sự đổi màu cho những bức tranh. Thế nên hãy là những người bước qua đời nhau như một sự thay đổi trải nghiệm muôn mầu của cuộc sống. Đừng quá bi ai sau một cuộc tình."</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sau mỗi cuộc tình tan vỡ, mỗi cuộc hôn nhân không hạnh phúc, lại là những niềm tin rạn nứt của những kẻ đã sờn lòng, đã thôi mong mỏi, thôi ao ước. Những câu chuyện chia tay, phản bội... nhan nhản ta đọc được mỗi ngày trên mạng, lại càng khiến định nghĩa về tình yêu thật sự trở nên mong manh và khó nắm bắt biết dường nào. Nhưng có phải thế không, có thực cuộc sống đã trở nên thực dụng và cõi lòng chúng ta ngày càng chai sạn đến độ, những tình yêu đẹp đẽ bền lâu chỉ có trong phim ảnh?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tôi đã tìm thấy câu trả lời cho nỗi băn khoăn ấy khi lần giở những trang viết của <em><strong>Không còn thời gian để buồn</strong>.</em> Đúng như tên gọi của nó – thật nhẹ nhõm và giản dị - cuốn sách đã khiến nỗi buồn trong ta vợi bớt tự bao giờ. Viết từ góc nhìn của một người vợ, người mẹ, và trên hết là một người phụ nữ từng lạc lối trong tình yêu như bao người phụ nữ khác, cuốn sách chạm đến trái tim ta bằng một niềm cảm thức dịu dàng, đầy trắc ẩn của một người đàn bà từng trải. Có thể dễ dàng bắt gặp hình ảnh mình đâu đó trong cuốn sách – bởi ai chẳng từng đi qua những tháng năm tuổi trẻ của tình yêu cuồng nhiệt và đôi khi là khờ dại? Nhưng hơn thế, ta còn thấy được hành trình của một người con gái khi dũng cảm bước qua một mối tình đã làm mình đau khổ nhiều hơn hạnh phúc, để tìm đến một nơi thực sự thuộc về mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Không còn thời gian để buồn </em></strong>còn đem đến một góc nhìn mới mẻ về cuộc sống hôn nhân, khi mà giờ đây, nhắc đến hôn nhân mỗi cô gái trẻ vẫn thường cảm thấy nhiều e ngại. Có ai đó từng nói: <em>Những cuộc hôn nhân ngày xưa thường lâu bền hơn giới trẻ bây giờ, bởi ngày xưa, người ta quan niệm khi một thứ đồ bị hỏng, người ta sẽ cố gắng tìm cách sửa chữa nó, còn giờ đây, người ta nhanh chóng bỏ nó đi để tìm đến một thứ khác tốt hơn</em>. Và hình ảnh về cuộc sống hôn nhân trong <strong><em>Không còn thời gian để buồn</em></strong> cũng vậy, không có những khoảnh khắc lãng mạn như những cuốn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-truyen-tieng-viet/sach-van-hoc.html">tiểu thuyết hay</a> phim ảnh, nhưng cũng ngọt ngào theo cách riêng của nó; vẫn có những tổn thương, rạn nứt đấy, nhưng thay vì chọn trách móc và buông tay nhau ngay khi có thể, người ta lại chọn cách thông cảm cho nhau – dù điều đó đôi khi lại là việc khó khăn nhất trên đời.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đọc<strong> <em>Không còn thời gian để buồn </em></strong>cũng giống như nhâm nhi một tách trà ấm áp trong một chiều mưa, xuyên suốt những trang viết là những mẩu chuyện rất đời thường – về một người phụ nữ bất hạnh trong hôn nhân, về những người bà, người chị trong gia đình, về một cuộc đánh ghen, hay câu chuyện mẹ chồng – nàng dâu muôn thuở... – chỉ vậy thôi mà khi thì khiến ta bật cười với những câu chuyện vụn vặt dí dỏm của cuộc sống vợ chồng, khi khiến ta thấy sống mũi cay cay. Chỉ vậy thôi, nhưng cũng đủ khiến ta trân trọng hơn những khoảnh khắc bình dị bên người ta thương – để thấy cuộc sống này dễ chịu, dễ yêu hơn ta vẫn nghĩ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>"Bạn chỉ có một cuộc đời để sống nhưng có nhiều cách để nghĩ. Mỗi người đều biết ngày sinh nhật của mình, nhưng chẳng ai biết được ngày về với vĩnh hằng.

Đồng thời, tất cả họ đều ý thức được những hậu quả của việc để lọt thông tin của mình vào tay đối phương, để lộ những bí mật quý giá cho các nước thù địch cũng như hậu quả của sự phản bội cung cấp thông tin sống còn cho các lực lượng đối kháng. Chính nỗi lo sợ bị kẻ thù xem trộm đã thúc đẩy sự ra đời và phát triển của mật mã: đó là những kỹ thuật nhằm che giấu, ngụy trang thông tin, khiến cho chỉ những người cần được nhận mới có thề đọc được<a class="hsogamehint">.</a></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mong muốn giữ bí mật đã khiến các quốc gia thiết lập những cơ quan mật mã, có nhiệm vụ đảm bảo an toàn cho thông tin liên lạc bằng việc phát mình và sử dụng những mật mã tốt nhất có thể được. Trong khi đó, những người phá mã của đối phương cũng lại cố gắng để giải mã và đánh cắp những bí mật. Người giải mã là những nhà “giả kim thuật” về ngôn ngữ, một nhóm người bí ẩn chuyên tìm cách phỏng đoán những từ ngữ có nghĩa từ những ký hiệu vô nghĩa. Lịch sử của mật mã là câu chuyện về cuộc chiến kéo dài hàng thế kỷ giữa người lập mã và người giải mã, cuộc chạy đua vũ khí trí tuệ đã có tác động rất to lớn đến tiến trình của lịch sử.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi viết cuốn Mật mã này, tác giả có hai mục đích chính. Một là nhằm phác họa sự tiến hóa của mật mã. Từ tiến hóa dùng ở đây là hoàn toàn thích hợp vì sự phát triển của mật mã cũng có thể coi là một cuộc đấu tranh tiến hoá. Một mật mã luôn bị người phá mã tấn công. Khi người phá mã đã tìm ra một vũ khí mới để phát hiện điểm yếu của một mật mã thì mật mã đó không còn hữu dụng nữa. Khi đó hoặc nó sẽ bị xoá sổ hoặc nó sẽ được cải tiến thành một loại mật mã mới, mạnh hơn. Đến lượt mình, mật mã mới này chỉ phát triển mạnh mẽ cho tới khi người phá mã lại xác định được điểm yếu của nó, và cứ tiếp tục mãi như vậy. Điều này cũng tương tự như tình huống đối mặt với một giống vi khuẩn gây bệnh chẳng hạn. Vi khuẩn sống, phát triển mạnh và tồn tại cho đến khi bác sĩ tìm ra chất kháng sinh làm lộ ra những điểm yếu của vi khuẩn và tiêu diệt nó. Vi khuẩn buộc phải tiến hoá và lừa lại kháng sinh, và nếu thành công thì chúng sẽ lại phát triển mạnh mẽ và tái xác lập trở lại. Vi khuẩn liên tục bị buộc phải tiến hoá để sống sót trước sự tấn công dữ dội của các loại kháng sinh mới.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuộc chiến liên miên giữa người lập mã và người phá mã đã thúc đẩy hàng loạt những đột phá khoa học đáng kể. Người lập mật mã đã liên tục cố gắng xây dựng những loại mã mạnh hơn bao giờ hết để bảo vệ thông tin, trong khi những người phá mã cũng lại kiên trì tìm ra những phương pháp mạnh hơn nữa để phá vở chúng. Trong những cố gắng nhằm phá vỡ và bảo vệ thông tin bí mật, cả hai phía đã phải huy động nhiều lĩnh vực chuyên môn và công nghệ khác nhau, từ toán học cho tới ngôn ngữ học từ lý thuyết thông tin cho đến lý thuyết lượng tử. Đổi lại, những người lập mã và phá mã cũng đã làm giàu thêm cho những lĩnh vực này và thành quả của họ đã đẩy nhanh tốc độ phát triển cộng nghệ, mà đáng kể nhất là trong lĩnh vực máy tính hiện đại…”</p>', '2014-09-14', 0, NULL, 6, 33, 'NXB Trẻ', 'null', NULL, 20, 137000, 195000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/mat-ma-tu-co-dien-den-luong-tu.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Thế nhưng nếu bạn đứng nhìn hai đường ray ấy, dường như chúng gặp nhau ở cuối tầm mắt và tàu không thể đi xa hơn nữa. Điều này thật không hợp lý, vì dù đứng ở Paris và không thể thấy Cannes, chúng ta vẫn có thể đón tàu từ Paris đến dự liên hoan phim tại Cannes. Nghịch lý hơn nữa, một nhà tư tưởng Hi Lạp cổ xưa đã lập luận rằng chuyến tàu của bạn phải đi hết một nửa quãng đường, rồi một nửa của quãng đường còn lại, rồi một nửa của quãng đường còn lại, rồi cứ tiếp tục đến vô hạn, và nếu thế bạn sẽ chẳng bao giờ đến nơi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Lập luận rất lôgic này rõ ràng lại không thực tế vì chúng ta luôn có thể đi bất cứ nơi đâu, như một em nhỏ giúp cụ già sang bên kia đường.

Trong lời mở đầu Rousseau viết: <em>“Với bản chất con người như ta biết, và với tính chất có thể xảy ra của luật pháp, tôi muốn tìm xem trong trật tự của một xã hội dân sự có thể có một luật lệ cai trị nào chắc chắn và hợp tình hợp lý...”</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong cuộc hành trình này, <strong>Rousseau</strong> cũng như các nhà tư tưởng trước ông như Thomas Hobbes và John Locke đều bắt đầu từ nguyên thủy, nhận diện con người trong trạng thái thiên nhiên của nó. Mở đầu chương thứ nhất Rousseau viết: <em>“Con người sinh ra được tự do, nhưng ở đâu họ cũng bị xiềng xích.</em>” Đối với <strong>Rousseau,</strong> tự do là điều kiện thiết yếu để con người là một con người. Trong trạng thái thiên nhiên mỗi con người là chủ của chính mình, nhưng từng cá nhân một không thể chống chọi với thiên nhiên để tự tồn m&agragrave; phải cùng chung sống với nhau hầu có đủ sức để sống còn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Từ xã hội sơ khai đầu tiên là gia đình, con người quần tụ thành những cộng đồng lớn hơn, nhưng trong cộng đồng lớn hơn này cần phải có luật lệ để điều hành trật tự sao cho phúc lợi và tự do của mỗi người vẫn được bảo đảm. Câu hỏi được đặt ra là ai sẽ là “người” đặt ra những luật lệ này khi mỗi cá nhân đều bình đẳng như nhau? Rousseau phủ nhận mô thức chính quyền quân chủ do Grotius và Hobbes đề ra, và lý giải rằng một xã hội dân sự hợp lý, hợp tình chỉ có thể được tạo nên bởi sự thỏa thuận của mọi người tham gia. Hay nói một cách khác bởi một khế ước xã hội do mọi người cùng lập nên và mọi người phải tuân thủ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Rousseau </strong>viết: <em>“Cái mà con người mất đi khi chấp nhận khế ước xã hội là sự tự do thiên nhiên và sự vô giới hạn trong những việc anh ta muốn làm và những gì anh ta muốn giữ khi chiếm được; bù lại cái mà anh ta nhận được là sự tự do trong văn minh và quyền sở hữu chính đáng những gì mà anh ta có”. “</em>Người” có thẩm quyền làm ra luật để cai trị một cộng đồng lập nên bởi khế ước xã hội, theo <strong>Rousseau</strong>, không ai khác hơn là tất cả mọi người đồng trao quyền đó cho một con người nhân tạo gọi là “Hội đồng Tối cao” (sovereign) bao gồm tất cả mọi người; con người nhân tạo này khi được thành hình bởi khế ước xã hội có đời sống và ý chí riêng. Ý chí riêng của con người nhân tạo này là ý chí của cả tập thể, gọi là “ý chí tập thể” (general will) nhằm đạt tới cái tốt chung cho cả cộng đồng.</p>', '2013-08-14', 0, NULL, 9, 13, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 240, 7, 63000, 79000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/khe-uoc-xa-hoi.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Chính vì vậy, nhiều người ở nhiều nơi sản xuất để phục vụ cho nhu cầu nói trên.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Từ trước đến nay, sản phẩm chính hầu hết đều là cây mai ghép. Với lòng mong muốn sẽ góp phần vào việc tạo thêm sản phẩm mới từ cây mai 12 cánh. Tác giả trình bày những kinh nghiệm đã làm được bằng cách giâm cành, chiết cành và giâm rễ (lấy rễ từ cành giâm hoặc chiết) của cây mai vàng 12 cánh nói trên.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu so sánh giữa sản xuất bằng cách ghép và giâm cành hoặc chiết cành thì cách sau “hơi lâu ăn” một chút! Nhưng vì mỗi đợt tỉa cành để tạo dáng cho cây mai, những cành bị cắt bỏ, nếu không lấy mắt ghép (bo) thì không biết để lại làm gì mà bỏ đi thì tiếc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Vậy, thay vì đem chúng bỏ đi, nếu đem giâm cành hay chiết nó rồi chăm sóc thì khoảng 3 năm sẽ có được nhiều cây mai thương phẩm. Đó là chưa kể trường hợp nếu bền chí trồng những cây mai được nhân giống theo kiểu này với thời gian lâu hơn thì có khả năng sẽ có nhiều cây mai Bonsai ưng ý.Sách in trên giấy couché, ảnh minh họa màu.</p>', '2012-03-14', 0, 284, 2, 32, 'NXB Văn Hoá Thông Tin', 'null', 50, 0, 16000, 20000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img167_6.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Chính bản thân ông cũng là thành viên của dịch vụ Amazon Prime - giao hàng trong hai ngày của Amazon. “Sẽ chẳng có ví dụ nào hay hơn. Có lẽ chỉ có thể là Apple, nhưng người ta quên rằng hầu hết mọi người tin Amazon đã sụp đổ do không đạt được quy mô kinh doanh cần thiết để trang trải kết cấu chi phí. Công ty liên tục thua lỗ hàng trăm triệu đô la. Nhưng Jeff quả thực là người có tài ăn nói và rất thông minh. Ông là một mẫu người sáng lập doanh nghiệp có chuyên môn điển hình nên hiểu từng chi tiết nhỏ nhất và cẩn trọng xem xét mọi khía cạnh hơn bất kỳ ai.”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Mặc dù giá cổ phiếu của công ty tăng cao chóng mặt trong thời gian gần đây, nhưng Amazon vẫn là công ty ẩn chứa những vấn đề kỳ lạ. Những chỉ số quan trọng trên bảng cân đối kế toán nổi tiếng là thiếu sức sống, và việc mở rộng vào thị trường và phân mục sản phẩm mới thậm chí khiến công ty có kết quả kinh doanh thua lỗ trong năm 2012. Nhưng Phố Wall dường như không quan tâm đến số liệu này. Jeff Bezos đưa ra những tuyên bố mạnh mẽ về việc đầu tư xây dựng công ty dài hạn nên tạo dựng lòng tin từ những cổ đông. Những nhà đầu tư sẵn sàng kiên nhẫn chờ đợi một ngày Jeff quyết định chậm lại quá trình mở rộng và nhận được lợi nhuận bền vững.  Bezos hoàn toàn không để ý tới ý kiến của người khác. Ông có khả năng giải quyết vấn đề, có tầm nhìn bao quát của một vị tướng chỉ huy trong cuộc chiến cạnh tranh và luôn hướng tới làm hài lòng khách hàng và cung cấp dịch vụ như giao hàng miễn phí. Ông có những tham vọng vô cùng lớn - không chỉ đối với Amazon, mà còn để thúc đẩy mở rộng giới hạn của khoa học và xây dựng lại lĩnh vực truyền thông.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Không chỉ thành lập công ty nghiên cứu vũ trụ Blue Origin của riêng mình, Bezos còn thâu tóm tờ báo gặp khó khăn Washington Post vào tháng 8 năm 2013 với giá 250 triệu đô la, một thương vụ gây choáng váng cho giới truyền thông. Như nhiều nhân viên dưới quyền chứng thực, làm việc với Bezos rất khó khăn và vất vả. Mặc dù, nổi tiếng với nụ cười nồng nhiệt và vui vẻ, Bezos có thể nổi giận gay gắt giống như người sáng lập của Apple, Steve Jobs, người có thể làm khiếp sợ bất kỳ nhân viên nào bước vào thang máy cùng ông. Bezos theo chủ nghĩa lãnh đạo hoàn hảo, quan tâm theo dõi đến từng chi tiết nhỏ nhất, liên tục cho ra những ý tưởng mới và phản ứng gay gắt với những nỗ lực làm việc không đáp ứng những yêu cầu nghiêm ngặt của ông. Giống như Jobs, Bezos thuộc tuýp người có khả năng bóp méo thực tại - vẽ ra viễn cảnh tươi sáng đầy thuyết phục nhưng rút cuộc thì lại chẳng mấy khi khiến họ thỏa mãn về công ty. Ông thường nói rằng sứ mệnh của Amazon là “phải nâng cao chuẩn mực trong các lĩnh vực và trên toàn thế giới với mục tiêu tập trung hướng tới khách hàng.” Bezos và nhân viên thực sự tập trung hướng tới đem lại lợi ích cho khách hàng, nhưng đồng thời cũng cạnh tranh không ngừng với đối thủ và thậm chí với cả đối tác. Bezos thích nói rằng thị trường Amazon tham gia cạnh tranh kinh doanh rộng lớn với rất nhiều cơ hội cho nhiều công ty thành công. Điều này có lẽ đúng, nhưng rõ ràng Amazon góp phần gây thiệt hại hoặc phá hủy những đối thủ cạnh tranh dù có quy mô kinh doanh lớn hay nhỏ, rất nhiều trong số đó là những thương hiệu được thế giới biết đến như: Circuit City, Borders, Best Buy, Barnes &amp; Noble.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Người Mỹ nói chung cảm thấy lo lắng về việc tập trung sức mạnh của những tập đoàn lớn, đặc biệt khi các tập đoàn đó có trụ sở ở những thành phố xa xôi. Thành công của những công ty này có thể thay đổi phong cách sống của toàn cộng đồng dân cư. Walmart là trường hợp điển hình phải đối mặt với sự hoài nghi này cùng với những cái tên khác như Sears, Woolworth’s, và gã bán lẻ tạp phẩm khổng lồ A&amp;P phải đối mặt với vụ kiện chống độc quyền có thể gây phá sản trong suốt những năm 1940. Người Mỹ đổ xô tới những nhà bán lẻ lớn vì sự tiện lợi và giá thành thấp. Nhưng ở một mức giá nhất định, những công ty này nhận được lợi nhuận lớn gây mâu thuẫn trong cộng đồng. Chúng tôi muốn hàng hóa giá rẻ, nhưng chúng tôi cũng không thực sự muốn bất kỳ ai phải từ bỏ những cửa hàng độc lập quy mô gia đình trên những con phố hoặc những cửa hàng sách nhỏ đã kinh doanh trong nhiều thập kỷ do sự phổ biến của chuỗi cửa hàng sách như Barnes &amp; Noble và giờ đây là Amazon.</p>', '2015-01-14', 0, 35, 16, 32, 'NXB Lao Động Xã Hội', 'null', 403, 17, 82000, 102000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/ky-nguyen-amazon.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Hai người hai hướng, chỉ còn con tim đang ngẩn ngơ vì tình.<br /><br />Là do người đánh mất hay vì người chưa từng có. Người tự yêu, tự an ủi trong mối tình vốn đã sớm nhận ra chẳng thể thành đôi. Người làm bộ như không sao cả, thời gian tự trôi rồi mọi thứ sẽ ổn. Nhưng hai chữ thất tình vẫn như giọt buồn tràn ly, ghim chặt thành sự ám ảnh.<br /><br />Người mượn tình cảm để chôn vùi tình cũ, mượn một tấm thân xa lạ để xoa dịu cơn đau, nuôi mộng bóng hình xưa sẽ tàn phai theo năm tháng. Rồi người nhận ra mình vừa vô trách nhiệm với mình,  lại đang gieo cả sự bất hạnh cho kẻ khác.<br /><br />Thất tình là thế đó, đủ câu chuyện với nhiều nỗi niềm mông lung. Nhẹ nhàng với những áng văn chương truyền cảm, Hôm nay tôi thất tình cùng Hạ Vũ nói hộ tấm chân tình da diết của biết bao kẻ đang cô đơn. Viết cho những ngày người uống thật say để không còn thương nữa. Người chỉ muốn ôm mặt mà bật khóc để vơi đi cái nhói đau đang quặn thắt trong lòng. Ngày qua ngày trôi đều như thế, kẻ đi rồi có biết được đâu.<br /><br />Hôm nay tôi thất tình, là cuốn nhật kí ghi lại những dấu ấn của tình yêu tuổi trẻ. Nơi cất lại những bức họa buồn được người tô vẽ trong vội vàng. Người muốn vượt qua nỗi buồn hãy cứ bình tĩnh, Xa người đó rồi, nhất định sẽ gặp được một kẻ tốt hơn. Ông trời sắp đặt cả rồi, không cần gấp. Người hãy như Hạ Vũ, cứ im lặng, đi xem phim, đi shopping, đi ăn, đi chơi với bạn bè, chăm chỉ lên lớp, chăm chỉ đi làm... Từng bị tổn thương một lần rồi, đừng dùng những hành vi ngây thơ trẻ con làm tổn thương chính mình để trả thù hay trút hết cảm xúc. Có thù hận nặng nề tới mấy kẻ đã bỏ buông cũng chẳng quay lại.<br /><br />Đó vượt qua thất tình không khó phải không? Hôm nay tôi thất tình, thở dài một cái, thả cảm xúc vào khoảng không, nhìn đời nhất có thể và người có thể thanh thản, dũng cảm đi tiếp đươc rồi.</p>', '2017-04-14', 1, 370, 3, 7, 'NXB Hà Nội', 'null', 200, 1, 69000, 86000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/anh-bia-1-01.u2487.d20161230.t145254.885105.jpg', '["\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img605.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img606.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img607.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img608.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img609.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img610.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img611.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img612.gif","\\/storage\\/app\\/anh-doc-thu\\/img613.gif"]', '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Hiểu về trái tim không như vậy, cuốn sách do một tác giả Việt Nam suy ngẫm, ngộ ra và viết. Bạn sẽ chẳng hiểu về nó nếu bạn đọc với suy nghĩ ngờ vực hay xét đoán. Hãy cứ đọc và cảm nhận những điều Minh Niệm chia sẻ bằng chính trái tim của bạn. Những chia sẻ từ trái tim thì nên cảm nhận bằng trái tim bạn ạ!<br /><br />Bạn sẽ chín chắn hơn, hiểu cuộc sống một cách mới và tích cực hơn sau khi đọc cuốn sách này đấy! Không dối lừa, chỉ toàn là sự thật thôi.<br /><br />Cuộc sống không phải toàn màu hồng, cũng không phải chỉ đầy hố đen. Và bạn hãy biết cân bằng cuộc sống của chính mình để luôn thấy hạnh phúc nhé! <br /><br />ĐÁNH GIÁ CỦA BẠN PHÚ PHÔ MAI (﻿myphudinh@... - TP HCM):<br /><br />Hạnh phúc là điều mà tất cả mọi người điều hướng tới nhưng con người cứ chăm lo cho giá trị hạnh phúc mang lại từ vật chất mà sống xa rời trái tim của mình. Vậy đến khi nào thì họ mới có được hạnh phúc thật sự khi mà họ bỏ ngoài tai những lời trái tim họ nói (hay họ cố tình không nghe). Và những gì trái tim con người lên tiếng đã được Minh Niệm cảm nhận và viết thành quyển "Hiểu về trái tim".<br /><br />Không chỉ giải mã lời trái tim mà tác giả còn chỉ cho chúng ta thấy những bí quyết để sống hạnh phúc, để không còn cảm thấy đau đáu mỗi khi thất bại, mỗi khi ngồi khâu mình trong góc tối mà chẳng biết ta nên làm gì. Không đơn giản chỉ là quyển sách dành riêng cho trái tim của mỗi người mà nó còn là phương thuốc hữu hiệu để giúp ta có thể chữa lành trái tim của người thân xung quanh mình. Cách tốt nhất để san lấp những nỗi đau là chia sẻ, nhưng nếu chúng ta không hiểu những nỗi đau đó xuất phát từ đâu thì làm sao chúng ta có thể xóa nhòa chúng.<br /><br />Vậy nên "Hiểu về trái tim" xứng đáng là một quyển sách tuyệt vời để mang lại giá trị sống hạnh phúc đích thực khi mà những giá trị ảo đang ngày càng thống trị trái tim mỗi người, để rồi một khi chúng ta không còn khả năng đáp ứng được vật chất nữa, chúng sẽ bỏ ta lại với một trái tim đã quá nhiều vết sẹo và có thể chẳng phục hồi lại được nữa.<br /><br />Cả đời người chỉ mong cuối cùng được sống hạnh phúc, vậy thì đừng đi lạc nữa, hãy tập lắng nghe trái tim và từ hôm nay, hãy đi theo lời trái tim nói dù cho con đường đó chông gai thế nào nhưng hãy tin phía cuối đường luôn tràn đầy hoa hồng.<br /><br />(Nhận xét tham gia chương trình "ĐÓN TẾT SÁCH TƯNG BỪNG, CHỈ VỚI MỘT "CÚ" LIKE" của Tiki.vn)<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Mỗi chúng ta được sinh ra với một trái tim và đều mong muốn trái tim mình khỏe mạnh, an vui. Vậy mà có biết bao trẻ em nghèo bất hạnh với chứng bệnh tim bẩm sinh không tiền chữa trị, còn người khỏe mạnh thì vì những đau khổ của cuộc sống không hạnh phúc mà trái tim cũng bị tổn thương, mỏi mệt... Tác giả Minh Niệm là vị thầy có những trải nghiệm lớn lao trong thiền định và đang là điểm tựa tinh thần cho rất nhiều thiền sinh trên thế giới. Những bài viết của ông giúp chúng ta tìm lại chính mình, nuôi dưỡng những hạt giống tốt trong tâm hồn như lòng bao dung, vị tha, lắng nghe, chia sẻ... đồng thời nhận biết và chuyển hóa những năng lượng tiêu cực của giận hờn, ghen tỵ, che đậy, tham lam, đố kỵ...<br /><br />“Để chữa lành những tổn thương và nổi đau, cách tốt nhứt và hữu hiệu nhất là cần hiểu rõ được trái tim, tâm hồn của mình, và của người khác, cuốn sách Hiểu về Trái Tim chính là cuốn sách giúp bạn đọc làm được điều đó: Hiểu rõ và chữa lành trái tim, tâm hồn của mình và của những người xung quanh, để mọi người cùng được sống trong hạnh phúc và yêu thương. Với cuốn sách này, chúc bạn đọc sẽ luôn hạnh phúc và không bao giờ phải sống với một trái tim tan vỡ hay một tâm hồn tổn thương” Giáo sư – Tiến sĩ Trần Văn Khê</p>', '2016-10-14', 0, 234, 1, 6, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', 480, 11, 96000, 120000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/hieu-ve-trai-tim.u2487.d20161014.t163044.788143.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Bạn có tự hỏi điều gì sẽ xảy ra sau khi bạn chết không? Có thể nào bạn có một linh hồn đến từ đâu đó và sẽ trở về đó sau khi thân xác bạn chết đi, hay đó chỉ là một điều ước ao vì bạn quá sợ hãi?<br /><br />Có một nghịch lý rằng con người, duy nhất trong mọi tạo vật trên Trái đất, phải kìm nén nỗi sợ cái chết để sống bình thường. Nhưng bản năng sinh học của chúng ta không bao giờ cho chúng ta quên nỗi nguy hiểm tối cao này của sự tồn tại của chúng ta. Khi chúng ta già đi, bóng ma của cái chết cũng lớn dần lên trong tâm trí chúng ta. Thậm chí cả những người theo tôn giáo cũng sợ cái chết là sự kết thúc của mỗi cá nhân. Nỗi sợ lớn nhất đối với cái chết đem đến những suy nghĩ về sự vô nghĩa của cái chết, điều kết thúc mọi mối liên hệ với gia đình và bạn bè. Cái chết làm cho mọi mục đích thực tiễn của chúng ta trở nên phù phiếm.<br /><br />Những câu trả lời đích thực cho đời sống sau cái chết vẫn được đóng kín sau cánh cửa tâm linh đối với đa số mọi người. Đó là bởi vì ở trong chúng ta vốn sẵn có khả năng quên đi danh tính của linh hồn chúng ta, điều mà ở mức độ nhận thức, sẽ giúp cho sự hợp nhất của linh hồn và bộ não con người. Những năm gần đây, công chúng đã được nghe về những người chết tạm thời và sau đó sống lại nói về một đường hầm dàagrave;i, ánh sáng rực rỡ và thậm chí những gặp gỡ ngắn ngủi với những linh hồn thân thiện. Nhưng không có một ấn phẩm nào trong số các cuốn sách đã được viết mang đến cho người đọc nhiều hơn một cái nhìn thoáng qua về tất cả những gì cần biết về cuộc đời sau cái chết.<br /><br />Cuốn sách này là một cuốn nhật ký gần gũi về thế giới linh hồn. Nó trình bày một loạt các trường hợp thể hiện chi tiết, rõ ràng về những gì xảy ra cho chúng ta khi cuộc sống trên Trái đất kết thúc. Bạn sẽ được dẫn qua đường hầm tâm linh để đến với chính thế giới linh hồn để tìm hiểu về những biến đổi đối với linh hồn trước khi chúng cuối cùng trở lại trên Trái đất trong một cuộc sống mới.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>', '2016-01-14', 0, 428, 16, 22, 'NXB Hồng Đức', 'null', 424, 11, 79000, 99000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bia_hanh-trinh-cua-linh-hon_out-01.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Vài năm sau đó, khi tủ lạnh nhà bạn lại đầy ắp những tác phẩm nghệ thuật mới, nghĩa là con cái của bạn đã trở thành những bậc phụ huynh. Khi đã lên chức ông, chức bà, bạn sẽ càng say mê hơn với các tác phẩm nghệ thuật trên cánh cửa tủ lạnh và sẵn sàng dán lên đó bất cứ thứ gì mà lũ cháu nội, ngoại yêu cầu.”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hay trong <strong>“Trường học, trẻ con, người lớn và những điều phải học”</strong>, tác giả đưa ra một vấn đề mà khiến ta ngạc nhiên vì nó hẳn thế nhưng ta đã không để ý, đã để nó bị lấp đi:” Khi được hỏi tại nhà trẻ: “Bao nhiêu bạn ở đây có thể vẽ?”, mọi cánh tay đều giơ lên. Tất nhiên là tất cả chúng con đều biết vẽ. Thế các con có thể vẽ cái gì? Tất cả mọi thứ! Thế cảnh một con chó đang nuốt chiếc xe cứu hỏa trong rừng thì sao? Dĩ nhiên rồi. Thầy muốn con chó to cỡ nào?“Ai trong số các con có thể hát?”. Tất cả đều giơ tay. Tất nhiên là chúng con có thể hát! Các con biết hát bài gì nào? Tất cả các bài ạ! Nhưng nếu các con không thuộc lời thì sao? Không sao, chúng con sẽ tự chế lời. Có vấn đề gì đâu, bây giờ chúng ta hãy cùng hát nhé! Bây giờ ư? Tại sao không!(…) Câu trả lời của bọn trẻ luôn là “Có ạ!”. Lặp đi lặp lại như thế.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong mỗi đứa trẻ luôn có một sự tự tin bẩm sinh, một nguồn vui vô tận và khát khao học tập không ngừng. Với chúng, mọi thứ đều có thể thực hiện được.Thử hỏi với cùng những câu hỏi trên tại các trường đại học, cao đẳng. Chỉ một số rất nhỏ những cánh tay đưa lên khi sinh viên được hỏi họ có thể vẽ, có thể nhảy, có thể hát, có thể sơn màu, có thể diễn kịch hay chơi một nhạc cụ không. Không hiếm các trường hợp giơ tay đã trả lời cùng với một hạn định kiểu như: “Tôi chỉ chơi đàn piano, tôi chỉ vẽ về loài ngựa, tôi chỉ nhảy với nhạc rock and roll hay tôi chỉ hát dưới vòi hoa sen”.”Vậy điều gì đã tạo nên sự khác biệt ấy? Và vì sao chúng ta dần mất hết sự tự tin khi lớn lên?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Fulghum</strong> đưa ra vấn đề, và không ai khác là chính bạn phải có câu trả lời cho riêng mình.Những mẩu chuyện dung dị dưới nhãn quan rộng mở của<strong> Fulghum </strong>trong <strong>“Góc nhìn của người thông thái”</strong> đã được viết bằng một phong cách gần gũi và khiêm nhường, dí dỏm và hấp dẫn với sự thông thái của riêng ông. “Góc nhìn của người thông thái” đem lại cảm giác ấm áp như thể ta đang ngồi dưới mái hiên nhà bà mình vào một chiều chủ nhật, thong thả nhấm nháp từng ngụm kem mát lành…</p>', '2014-04-14', 0, 341, 1, 3, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', 240, 0, 50000, 62000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/goc-nhin-cua-nguoi-thong-thai.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Chúng ta không cần phải đi đâu xa để thực tập chánh niệm. Chúng ta có thể thực tập chánh niệm ngay trong phòng mình hoặc trên đường đi từ nơi này đến nơi khác. Ta vẫn có thể tiếp tục làm những công việc ta thường làm hằng ngày như đi, đứng, nằm, ngồi, làm việc, ăn, uống, giao tiếp, chuyện trò… nhưng với ý thức là mình đang làm những công việc ấy. Hãy tưởng tượng ta đang ngắm mặt trời mọc với một số người. Trong khi những người khác đang thưởng thức khung cảnh đẹp đẽ ấy thì ta lại “bận rộn” với những thứ trong đầu mình. Ta bận rộn và lo lắng cho những kế hoạch của ta. Ta nghĩ về quá khứ hoặc tương lai mà không thực sự có mặt để trân quý cơ hội đó. Thay vì thưởng thức cảnh đẹp của buổi bình minh, ta lại để cho những khoảnh khắc quý giá ấy trôi qua oan uổng. Nếu quả thực như vậy, ta có thể sử dụng một phương pháp khác. Mỗi khi tâm ta đi lang thang thì ta kéo tâm về và tập trung tâm ý vào hơi thở vào - ra.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thực tập hơi thở ý thức giúp ta trở về với giây phút hiện tại. Thân tâm hợp nhất, ta sẽ có mặt trọn vẹn để ngắm nhìn, quán chiếu và thưởng thức khung cảnh đẹp đẽ ấy. Bằng cách trở về với hơi thở, ta lấy lại được sự mầu nhiệm của buổi bình minh. Chúng ta thường quá bận rộn đến nỗi quên mình đang làm gì, hoặc có khi ta quên mình là ai. Thậm chí có người quên mất là mình đang thở. Ta quên nhìn những người thương của ta và trân quý sự có mặt của họ, cho đến một ngày họ đi xa hay qua đời ta mới thấy hối tiếc. Có khi rảnh rỗi đi nữa, ta cũng không biết cách tiếp xúc với những gì đang xảy ra trong ta. Vì vậy ta mở ti vi lên xem hoặc nhấc <a href="https://tiki.vn/dien-thoai-smartphone/c1795">điện thoại</a> gọi cho ai đó. Ta nghĩ làm như thế là ta có thể trốn thoát được chính mình. Ý thức về hơi thở là tinh yếu của chánh niệm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Theo lời Bụt dạy, chánh niệm là nguồn suối phát sinh hỷ lạc. Hạt giống chánh niệm có trong mỗi chúng ta nhưng thường thì ta quên tưới tẩm hạt giống đó. Nếu biết cách nương vào hơi thở, nương vào bước chân của mình, chúng ta có thể tiếp xúc được với những hạt giống an lành ấy và cho phép chúng biểu hiện. Thay vì nương vào những ý niệm trừu tượng về Bụt, về Chúa hoặc về Allah, chúng ta có thể tiếp xúc được với Bụt, với Chúa trong từng hơi thở và bước chân của mình. Điều này nghe có vẻ dễ dàng và ai cũng có thể làm được, tuy nhiên đòi hỏi ở chúng ta một sự tập luyện. Quan trọng là tập dừng lại. Dừng lại như thế nào? Dừng lại bằng hơi thở vào ra và bước chân của mình. Vì vậy pháp môn căn bản của chúng ta là hơi thở ý thức và bước chân chánh niệm. Nếu nắm vững những pháp môn này, chúng ta có thể ăn, uống, nấu nướng, làm việc, lái xe… trong chánh niệm. Và chúng ta luôn luôn an trú trong giây phút hiện tại, bây giờ ở đây.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Thực tập chánh niệm (smrti) đưa đến định (samadhi) và định đưa đến tuệ (prajna). Tuệ giác mà ta đạt được từ sự thực tập chánh niệm có khả năng giải phóng chúng ta ra khỏi những tình trạng sợ hãi, lo âu, tuyệt vọng và đem lại hạnh phúc đích thực cho ta. Chúng ta có thể sử dụng những đối tượng đơn giản như bông hoa để thực tập chánh niệm. Khi cầm bông hoa trong tay, chúng ta ý thức về bông hoa. Hơi thở vào ra giúp ta duy trì ý thức. Thay vì để cho những suy nghĩ trấn ngự hoặc lôi kéo, ta trở về có mặt cho bông hoa và thưởng thức vẻ đẹp của bông hoa. Định lực sẽ trở thành nguồn suối phát sinh niềm vui trong ta.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Để thưởng thức trọn vẹn những món quà mà cuộc sống ban tặng, chúng ta phải thực tập chánh niệm trong mọi lúc, mọi nơi dù đang đánh răng, chuẩn bị thức ăn sáng hay lái xe đi làm. Mỗi bước chân, mỗi hơi thở có thể là một cơ hội đem đến cho ta niềm vui và hạnh phúc. Cuộc sống đầy dẫy khổ đau. Nếu không đủ hạnh phúc, ta sẽ không chăm sóc được nỗi khổ đau và tuyệt vọng của mình. Chúng ta hãy thực tập với tinh thần nhẹ nhàng thư thái, với tâm hồn rộng mở bao la và với một trái tim sẵn sàng lắng nghe, chấp nhận. Thực tập là để nuôi lớn hiểu biết chứ không phải để phô trương hình thức. Có chánh niệm, ta có thể nuôi lớn được niềm vui trong ta, giúp ta xử lý tốt hơn những khó khăn thách thức trong cuộc sống và biết cách chế tác tự do, an lạc, thương yêu trong mỗi chúng ta.</p>', '2014-07-14', 0, NULL, 16, 2, 'NXB Lao Động Xã Hội', 'null', 326, 3, 39000, 49000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/kho347.u2377.d20160919.t132221.457173.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Còn gì ý nghĩa hơn việc cha mẹ dành một khoảng thời gian trong ngày đọc truyện cho trẻ nghe, và hỏi con về những bài học sau mỗi câu chuyện giản dị ấy. Bộ truyện Ehon chắc chắn sẽ là món quà tuyệt vời dành tặng cho cả cha mẹ và trẻ trong dịp hè này.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cá voi ơi lớn nhanh nào</strong>: Là câu chuyện rất ngắn và đáng yêu vô cùng về mẹ con nhà cá voi nơi đại dương sâu thẳm, ở đó Cá voi con được mẹ dạy rất nhiều điều lý thú và bổ ích.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chiến công đầu tiên của bé Mi</strong>: Là hành trình bé Mi dễ thương lần đầu tiên một mình đi mua đồ phụ mẹ - dù chỉ là hành trình ngắn ngủi nhưng qua con mắt của các em, lại là một chuyến phiêu lưu vừa kỳ thú vừa gian nan.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trường mẫu giáo của chú voi Grumpa</strong>: Sẽ mang đến cho các bé và cả cha mẹ các bé một câu chuyện không dài nhưng tràn ngập niềm vui và trăn trở rất “trẻ con” của chú voi Grumpa ngây thơ trong cuộc tìm kiếm công việc mình yêu thích.</p>', '2014-06-14', 0, 291, 5, 22, 'NXB Văn Học', 'null', 36, 9, 23000, 29000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/chien-cong-cua-be-mi.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Sở dĩ như vậy, vì ngôn ngữ Ehon trong sáng, hồn nhiên; nội dung Ehon phong phú; đề tài Ehon đa dạng; tranh vẽ minh hoa Ehon tỉ mỉ, sâu sắc, màu sắc hài hòa,... được phân theo từng độ tuổi phát triển của trẻ, để phù hợp với sự tập trung và tiếp thu của trẻ ở các giai đoạn khác nhau.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhiều cha mẹ quan niệm rằng trẻ nhỏ chưa nhận thức được nội dung truyện? Tuy nhiên, các chuyên gia trên thế giới khuyên rằng nên đọc truyện cho trẻ nghe càng sớm càng tốt, bởi vì giai đoạn từ 0 đến 6 là giai đoạn vô cùng quan trọng để phát triển não bộ của trẻ. Cùng con đọc sách sẽ là khoảng thời gian để qua đó cha mẹ có thể kích thích sự phát triển cả năm giác quan cho bé, tay sờ, mắt nhìn, <a href="http://tiki.vn/tai-nghe-nhac/c1804">tai nghe</a>, miệng ê a phấn khích; đọc cho bé nghe cũng là cơ hội tuyệt vời để các bố mẹ gần gũi, âu yếm và gắn kết tình cảm bền chặt với con.

Khi tham gia chơi trò chơi ở trường mẫu giáo, Sachi muốn được một lần đóng vai mẹ. Nhưng các bạn cùng lớp đều không đồng ý để bé làm mẹ, với lý do là tay phải của em không có ngón.

Từ đó, sách đưa ra phương pháp luận để mỗi người tự thấu hiểu bản thân, tự tìm ra đường đời của mình, hình thành đạo nhân, đạo sống và đạo nghề của riêng mình. Hay nói cách khác, “Đúng Việc” là một phương pháp luận để góp sức cho mỗi người, mỗi nhà, mỗi tổ chức và mỗi xứ sở trên hành trình tự tìm ra “đích đến” và “con đường” cho sự đổi thay có tính cách mạng của riêng mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trích đoạn:</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Công việc" của bất kỳ ai trong đời cũng bao gồm làm người, làm dân và làm nghề.

Đắm mình vào trang sách, độc giả như được cùng ông cảm nhận sức nóng của “Hỏa Diệm Sơn”; lắng nghe tiếng sóng vỗ trên Hồng Hải; hồi hộp chờ ngắm núi lửa thức giấc tại Sicilia hay đón mặt trời lúc nửa đêm tại Mũi Bắc(North Cape) - Na Uy.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Không dừng lại ở những câu chuyện “đường xa xứ lạ”, sức cuốn hút mãnh liệt từ những trang viết của <strong>Nguyễn Tường Bách</strong> còn là nhiều phát hiện bất ngờ và thú vị về mỗi xứ sở, kết tủa từ trải nghiệm và tri thức. Ngôi đền Phật giáo lớn nhất thế giới mang đậm nét của Kim Cương Thừa lại nằm ở Indonesia-quốc gia có cộng đồng hồi giáo đông nhất thế giới. Cuộc chiến thành Troy lại không diễn ra trên đất Hy Lạp mà là Thổ Nhĩ Kỳ. Amsterdam là thành phố của những người không ưa khuôn phép, nơi mà người ta “sẵn sàng phá vỡ mọi lề thói, dám hợp thức hóa những điều cấm kỵ”. Nhờ vậy mà “lầu xanh, lầu hồng và cả khu vực tiêu thụ bạch phiến được ghi chính thức trên bản đồ thành phố”. Thăm Bồ Đào Nha, tác giả “chứng minh” một cách thuyết phục rằng giáo sĩ Dòng Tên người Bồ Francisco de Pina chính là người đã sáng tạo ra chữ quốc ngữ chứ không phải Alexandre de Rhodes, một nhà truyền giáo người Pháp - học trò của ông.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Đường xa nắng mới </strong>xứng đáng có vị trí trang trọng trên kệ sách của những người đam mê du lịch thám hiểm, tâm linh.

Phần 1 với tựa đề <strong><em>Chuyện kể cho bé </em></strong>là 14 câu chuyện chị Phan Thị Hồ Điệp tự sáng tác để kể cho con nghe trước giờ đi ngủ. Đó là những câu chuyện nhỏ xinh về bạn Mèo, bạn Thỏ; là câu chuyện về những sự kiện gắn bó với con như dịp sinh nhật, lần chia tay với bạn răng sún, là câu chuyện về ông già Noel huyền thoại nhưng vô cùng thân thiết, đáng yêu… Cứ thế, tuổi thơ của Đỗ Nhật Nam chìm đắm trong thế giới đầy màu nhiệm do chính mẹ em tạo ra. Và đó cũng là những giây phút hạnh phúc nhất trong cuộc đời làm mẹ của tác giả như chính chị tự chia sẻ trong <em>Lời nói đầu</em> của cuốn sách: "<em>Mỗi lần nhớ lại những đêm hai mẹ con nằm rì rầm kể chuyện và rúc rích cười, mình thấy bồi hồi, xao xuyến lắm. Ấu thơ của mỗi người như ánh sao trên bầu trời đêm. Chúng cứ hiện hữu lấp lánh, gần gũi mà cũng xa xôi. Con càng lớn, mẹ càng ít có cơ hội được "chạm vào những ánh sao ấy. Ấu thơ của con khi đó ẩn hiện trong trí nhớ mẹ lung linh, dịu dàng".</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong phần 1 này, bên cạnh mục <strong><em>Mẹ kể con nghe</em></strong> là mục <strong><em>Con nói mẹ nghe</em></strong>, trong đó tác giả gợi ý những câu hỏi nhỏ để mẹ con cùng trò chuyện, để con nói mẹ nghe về những điều ngộ nghĩnh, ngây thơ, chỉ trẻ con mới có. Đây là một phần đặc sắc của cuốn sách, giúp mẹ con có thể gắn kết với nhau, để bé có thể phát huy trí tưởng tượng của mình, phát triển hơn nữa khả năng giao tiếp chứ không đơn thuần là đọc sách cho con nghe. Với chị, yêu thương không nhất thiết phải cho roi cho vọt mà là dạy con biết yêu thương, khơi gợi cho con tính sáng tạo, truyền cho con sức mạnh, niềm tin, hi vọng trong cuộc sống. Và hạnh phúc làm mẹ đơn giản là <strong><em>Dưới sao mẹ kể con nghe</em></strong>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phần 2 với tựa đề <strong><em>Chuyện dành cho… mẹ </em></strong>là những bài thơ, những câu chuyện nhỏ nhưng nói kỹ hơn về cách chị Phan Thị Hồ Điệp đã thực hiện khi nuôi dạy con trai Đỗ Nhật Nam. Đó cũng là những gợi ý dạy con của chị dành cho các bậc phụ huynh, vì thế phần hai là dành cho mẹ - những bà mẹ mà tác giả luôn yêu quý và muốn truyền cảm hứng nuôi dạy con.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách hơn 100 trang với hình ảnh đẹp, minh họa trong sáng dễ thương ghi dấu kỉ niệm ngọt ngào, êm dịu của chị với cậu con trai bé bỏng. Hằng đêm, khi những ngôi sao trên bầu trời bắt đầu thắp sáng, cậu bé Nam say sưa nghe mẹ kể chuyện. Có lẽ đây chính là ngọn lửa khơi nguồn cho đam mê của Nam với ngôn ngữ và sách. Bởi lẽ, mẹ truyền cả <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a>, niềm tin, hi vọng và sức mạnh cho cậu bé thông qua những gì gần gũi nhất. Chị khuyến khích con tự khám phá và thực hành những bài học rút ra sau mỗi câu chuyện mẹ kể. Và điều đó đã trở thành hành trang theo Đỗ Nhật Nam suốt những ngày tháng sau này. Những bài học đầu đời về tình yêu thiên nhiên, con người đã bồi đắp cho cậu bé một tâm hồn trong sáng, nhân hậu để ngày nay cậu lan toả và chia sẻ tình yêu đó đến mọi người.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với bạn đọc, hãy cầm cuốn sách trên tay để đồng cảm với trái tim người mẹ và cảm nhận điều tuyệt diệu nhất trong vũ trụ này - Tình Mẹ.</p>', '2016-03-14', 0, 328, 16, 9, 'NXB Lao Động', 'null', 107, 0, 52000, 65000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bia_duoi_sao_me_ke_con_nghe-01.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Cho đến khi một người Mỹ bắt tay vào cuộc… Đó chính là Larry Berman, nhà sử học, giáo sư chính trị học thuộc đại học California, một chuyên gia xuất sắc chuyên nghiên cứu về cuộc chiến tranh xâm lược Việt Nam của Mỹ. Năm 2007, quyển sách <em>Perfect Spy - </em><em>The Incredible Double Life of PHAM XUAN AN Time Magazine Reporter &amp; Vietnamese Communist Agent (Điệp viên hoàn hảo – Hai cuộc đời khó tin (hay cuộc đời hai mặt theo cách gọi của Phương Tây về   Phạm Xuân Ẩn, phóng viên tạp chí Reuters, Time và tướng tình báo Cộng sản Việt Nam))</em> của Larry Berman được xuất bản lần đầu tiên tại Mỹ đã gây chấn động dư luận Mỹ, kiều bào Việt Nam ở Mỹ và cả ở Việt Nam. Vì trước khi quyển sách này ra đời, rất ít người biết và hiểu về tướng tình báo Phạm Xuân Ẩn, mặc dù ông là một nh&acircacirc;n vật huyền thoại của chiến tranh Việt Nam. Có lẽ bởi vì cuộc đời của Phạm Xuân Ẩn, cũng giống như tên của ông, chứa đựng nhiều bí ẩn về con người và sự nghiệp của một nhà tình báo vĩ đại, tài năng và bản lĩnh nhưng lại vô cùng khiêm nhường, bình dị.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phạm Xuân Ẩn (sinh ngày 12/9/1927, mất ngày 20/9/2006) tham gia hoạt động cách mạng từ đầu thập niên 1950, năm 1953 được kết nạp Đảng và được giao nhiệm vụ hoạt động điệp báo. Nhằm tạo vỏ bọc tốt hơn để có thể thâm nhập sâu hơn vào giới chức chính quyền và quân đội Sài Gòn, năm 1957 ông được cấp trên bố trí cho sang Mỹ học ngành báo chí. Năm 1959, Phạm Xuân Ẩn về nước, làm việc cho Hãng tin <em>Reuter</em>s và sau đó là tạp chí hàng đầu <em>Time, New York Herald Tribune </em> của Mỹ. Với kiến thức uyên bác, hiểu biết rộng, cương trực và tài năng giao tiếp, ngoại giao khác biệt, độc đáo theo kiểu lãng tử, hào hoa, ngang tàng, “chửi thề như bắp rang”, xuất hiện với phong cách thượng lưu, thừa hưởng văn hóa được đào tạo chính qui từ Mỹ, ông đã thâm nhập và là bạn tri kỷ với các tướng lĩnh, trùm an ninh mật vụ cả Mỹ và Sài Gòn, giới báo chí Việt Nam Cộng Hòa và Mỹ cũng như các chính khách chóp bu của chính quyền Sài Gòn để khai thác những thông tin tuyệt mật mang tầm chiến lược cho cuộc đối đầu của Bắc Việt Nam với Mỹ và chính quyền Sài Gòn. Cuộc đời hoạt động tình báo đầy ly kỳ hấp dẫn nhưng cũng vô cùng hiểm nguy của Phạm Xuân Ẩn với bí danh X6 thuộc cụm tình báo H63 được thể hiện một cách trung thực, sinh động trong cuốn <em>Điệp viên hoàn hảo X6 </em> được bổ sung cập nhật mới.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sau 6 năm, cuốn sách với những thông tin có giá trị lịch sử giờ đây lại được ra mắt bạn đọc qua một bản dịch đầy đủ và cập nhật nhiều thông tin chưa từng được công bố do chính Phạm Xuân Ẩn tiết lộ với tác giả <em>Larry Berman </em>có ghi âm. Với lời hứa chỉ được công bố những thông tin này từng giai đoạn sau khi Phạm Xuân Ẩn mất, Larry Berman đã mất 6 năm để cân nhắc để từng bước công bố thông tin của người đã khuất.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong ấn bản lần này, ở đầu sách có lời cảm nhận của nguyên Phó Thủ tướng Trương Vĩnh Trọng, với tựa đề “Nhớ mãi một con người”, trong đó có đoạn: <em>“</em><em>Phạm Xuân Ẩn là nhà tình báo chiến lược cực kỳ quan trọng. Anh đã sống một cuộc đời đầy nhiệt huyết giữa hai chiến tuyến, hai làn đạn. Một nhà báo Reuters và Time được cả chính khách Mỹ nể trọng. Một tình báo, một người yêu nước thật sự đã đóng góp rất nhiều cho sự nghiệp giải phóng dân tộc với một nhân cách đặc biệt, một tấm lòng của một người Việt Nam chân chính. Hiếm có một nhà tình báo nào trên thế giới để lại những bí ẩn và tình cảm tốt đẹp cho mọi người từ cả hai phía như nhà tình báo Phạm Xuân Ẩn”.</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong bài <em>Một phần của hình hài Tổ quốc </em>viết cho ấn bản mới cuốn <em>Điệp viên hoàn hảo</em>, ông Đào Văn Lừng, Vụ trưởng, Trưởng cơ quan Thường trực Ban Tuyên giáo Trung ương tại Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh khẳng định:<strong> <em>“</em></strong><em>Thiếu tướng-Anh hùng LLVT - đó là sự vinh danh của Tổ quốc dành cho nhà tình báo chiến lược Phạm Xuân Ẩn. Nhưng tên tuổi của Ông còn đi xa hơn thế, đặc biệt với những người bên kia chiến tuyến. Điều lạ lùng là ngay cả khi nhiệm vụ thực sự của Ông được công bố, Phạm Xuân Ẩn vẫn giành được sự kính trọng và ngưỡng mộ tuyệt đối từ những đối thủ của mình! Hàng loạt các chính khách, nhà ngoại giao, nhà nghiên cứu… từ Mỹ nva2 trên thế giới khi đến Việt Nam đều mong muốn được diện kiến ông là một minh chứng! Đặc biệt giáo sư, nhà sử học Mỹ Larry Berman đã dành nhiều năm với gần 30 lần bay từ Mỹ đến Việt Nam để gặp và phỏng vấn “đối thủ”lớn của ngành tình báo Mỹ sừng sỏ cho thấy sự hấp dẫn của Phạm Xuân Ẩn – một người do chính nước Mỹ góp phần “đào tạo” nên!”</em><strong> </strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ấn bản mới này có bổ sung Lời giới thiệu của tác giả cho lần tái bản 2013 “Sáu năm sau: hồi tưởng về <strong><em>Điệp Viên Hoàn Hảo</em></strong><em>”</em>. Larry Berman viết: <em>“…</em><em>cuộc đời của Ẩn không chỉ là một câu chuyện chiến tranh mà còn là câu chuyện về hàn gắn, về lòng trung thành với đất nước và bạn bè. Trong ấn bản mới, tôi đã thêm vào những câu chuyện và tình tiết mới mà hồi năm 2007 chưa thể kể ra. Tôi cũng phản ánh lại việc một số độc giả dân sự và quân sự Mỹ đã phản ứng về cuốn sách của tôi cũng như về nhân vật/con người Phạm Xuân Ẩn như thế nào. Tuy nhiên, điều làm cho ấn bản mới này trở nên rất quan trọng đó là bản dịch mới. Độc giả Việt Nam sẽ lần đầu tiên được đọc câu chuyện về cuộc đời phi thường của Phạm Xuân Ẩn như chính những gì mà ông đã kể với tôi, một người Mỹ viết hồi ký cho ông. Điều này làm cho ấn bản của First News - Trí Việt vừa rất đặc biệt, vừa là một cuốn sách mới chứa đựng rất nhiều thông tin lần đầu tiên công bố…”</em>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đặc biệt trong lần in mới này công bố bức thư xúc động của bà Thu Nhàn, vợ thiếu tướng Phạm Xuân Ẩn, gửi tác giả Larry Berman: <em>“</em><em>Do mắt kém, tôi phải đọc cuốn sách của ông ba lần trong suốt ba ngày, dù tôi muốn đọc xong ngay lập tức: ba ngày đầy cảm xúc, ba ngày đầy nước mắt nhớ thương, đầy <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> và sự tiếc nuối… Và giờ đây, mỗi lần đọc lại là tôi không cầm được nước mắt! Một ít người bạn của tôi cũng có cảm xúc như vậy… Nhưng tôi muốn đọc lại nhiều lần để nhớ về chồng tôi. </em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Đôi lúc, tôi cảm thấy như anh Ẩn còn sống, nhưng thật đau đớn, tôi mãi mãi không thể gặp anh ấy ở bất cứ nơi nào trong cuộc đời thực này nữa. Một nửa thân thể tôi đã chết! Càng thêm tuổi, tôi càng thấy cô đơn khi không còn anh ấy.

Với kiến thức uyên bác, hiểu biết rộng, cương trực và tài năng giao tiếp, ngoại giao khác biệt, độc đáo theo kiểu lãng tử, hào hoa, ngang tàng, “chửi thề như bắp rang”, xuất hiện với phong cách thượng lưu, thừa hưởng văn hóa được đào tạo chính qui từ Mỹ, ông đã thâm nhập và là bạn tri kỷ với các tướng lĩnh, trùm an ninh mật vụ cả Mỹ và Sài Gòn, giới báo chí Việt Nam Cộng Hòa và Mỹ cũng như các chính khách chóp bu của chính quyền Sài Gòn để khai thác những thông tin tuyệt mật mang tầm chiến lược cho cuộc đối đầu của Bắc Việt Nam với Mỹ và chính quyền Sài Gòn. Cuộc đời hoạt động tình báo đầy ly kỳ hấp dẫn nhưng cũng vô cùng hiểm nguy của Phạm Xuân Ẩn với bí danh X6 thuộc cụm tình báo H63 được thể hiện một cách trung thực, sinh động trong cuốn <em>Điệp viên hoàn hảo X6 </em> được bổ sung cập nhật mới.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sau 6 năm, cuốn sách với những thông tin có giá trị lịch sử giờ đây lại được ra mắt bạn đọc qua một bản dịch đầy đủ và cập nhật nhiều thông tin chưa từng được công bố do chính Phạm Xuân Ẩn tiết lộ với tác giả <em>Larry Berman </em>có ghi âm. Với lời hứa chỉ được công bố những thông tin này từng giai đoạn sau khi Phạm Xuân Ẩn mất, Larry Berman đã mất 6 năm để cân nhắc để từng bước công bố thông tin của người đã khuất.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong ấn bản lần này, ở đầu sách có lời cảm nhận của nguyên Phó Thủ tướng Trương Vĩnh Trọng, với tựa đề “Nhớ mãi một con người”, trong đó có đoạn: <em>“</em><em>Phạm Xuân Ẩn là nhà tình báo chiến lược cực kỳ quan trọng. Anh đã sống một cuộc đời đầy nhiệt huyết giữa hai chiến tuyến, hai làn đạn. Một nhà báo Reuters và Time được cả chính khách Mỹ nể trọng. Một tình báo, một người yêu nước thật sự đã đóng góp rất nhiều cho sự nghiệp giải phóng dân tộc với một nhân cách đặc biệt, một tấm lòng của một người Việt Nam chân chính. Hiếm có một nhà tình báo nào trên thế giới để lại những bí ẩn và tình cảm tốt đẹp cho mọi người từ cả hai phía như nhà tình báo Phạm Xuân Ẩn”.</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong bài <em>Một phần của hình hài Tổ quốc </em>viết cho ấn bản mới cuốn <em>Điệp viên hoàn hảo</em>, ông Đào Văn Lừng, Vụ trưởng, Trưởng cơ quan Thường trực Ban Tuyên giáo Trung ương tại Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh khẳng định:<strong> <em>“</em></strong><em>Thiếu tướng-Anh hùng LLVT - đó là sự vinh danh của Tổ quốc dành cho nhà tình báo chiến lược Phạm Xuân Ẩn. Nhưng tên tuổi của Ông còn đi xa hơn thế, đặc biệt với những người bên kia chiến tuyến. Điều lạ lùng là ngay cả khi nhiệm vụ thực sự của Ông được công bố, Phạm Xuân Ẩn vẫn giành được sự kính trọng và ngưỡng mộ tuyệt đối từ những đối thủ của mình! Hàng loạt các chính khách, nhà ngoại giao, nhà nghiên cứu… từ Mỹ nva2 trên thế giới khi đến Việt Nam đều mong muốn được diện kiến ông là một minh chứng! Đặc biệt giáo sư, nhà sử học Mỹ Larry Berman đã dành nhiều năm với gần 30 lần bay từ Mỹ đến Việt Nam để gặp và phỏng vấn “đối thủ”lớn của ngành tình báo Mỹ sừng sỏ cho thấy sự hấp dẫn của Phạm Xuân Ẩn – một người do chính nước Mỹ góp phần “đào tạo” nên!”</em><strong> </strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ấn bản mới này có bổ sung Lời giới thiệu của tác giả cho lần tái bản 2013 “Sáu năm sau: hồi tưởng về <strong><em>Điệp Viên Hoàn Hảo</em></strong><em>”</em>. Larry Berman viết: <em>“…</em><em>cuộc đời của Ẩn không chỉ là một câu chuyện chiến tranh mà còn là câu chuyện về hàn gắn, về lòng trung thành với đất nước và bạn bè. Trong ấn bản mới, tôi đã thêm vào những câu chuyện và tình tiết mới mà hồi năm 2007 chưa thể kể ra. Tôi cũng phản ánh lại việc một số độc giả dân sự và quân sự Mỹ đã phản ứng về cuốn sách của tôi cũng như về nhân vật/con người Phạm Xuân Ẩn như thế nào. Tuy nhiên, điều làm cho ấn bản mới này trở nên rất quan trọng đó là bản dịch mới. Độc giả Việt Nam sẽ lần đầu tiên được đọc câu chuyện về cuộc đời phi thường của Phạm Xuân Ẩn như chính những gì mà ông đã kể với tôi, một người Mỹ viết hồi ký cho ông. Điều này làm cho ấn bản của First News - Trí Việt vừa rất đặc biệt, vừa là một cuốn sách mới chứa đựng rất nhiều thông tin lần đầu tiên công bố…”</em>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đặc biệt trong lần in mới này công bố bức thư xúc động của bà Thu Nhàn, vợ thiếu tướng Phạm Xuân Ẩn, gửi tác giả Larry Berman: <em>“</em><em>Do mắt kém, tôi phải đọc cuốn sách của ông ba lần trong suốt ba ngày, dù tôi muốn đọc xong ngay lập tức: ba ngày đầy cảm xúc, ba ngày đầy nước mắt nhớ thương, đầy <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> và sự tiếc nuối… Và giờ đây, mỗi lần đọc lại là tôi không cầm được nước mắt! Một ít người bạn của tôi cũng có cảm xúc như vậy… Nhưng tôi muốn đọc lại nhiều lần để nhớ về chồng tôi. </em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Đôi lúc, tôi cảm thấy như anh Ẩn còn sống, nhưng thật đau đớn, tôi mãi mãi không thể gặp anh ấy ở bất cứ nơi nào trong cuộc đời thực này nữa. Một nửa thân thể tôi đã chết! Càng thêm tuổi, tôi càng thấy cô đơn khi không còn anh ấy.

Ngày nay, người chiến thắng là người dám từ bỏ, và người biết từ bỏ sẽ giành chiến thắng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đối với bất kỳ sự việc nào – bắt tay vào thực hiện một dự án, một công việc, chơi một môn thể thao ưa thích hay thành lập một công ty... - giai đoạn khởi đầu bao giờ cũng đầy hứng khởi. Nhưng sau đó, niềm say mê ban đầu dần mất đi và thay vào đó là những khó khăn, thử thách. Bạn cố gắng, cố gắng liên tục, cho đến khi bạn tự hỏi: Liệu những nỗ lực của mình có được đền đáp xứng đáng không? Đó chính là lúc bạn thấy tương lai mịt mù, thấy những nỗ lực của mình gần như vô nghĩa. Tác giả Seth Godin gọi thời điểm đó là Điểm thử thách - đó có thể là giai đoạn khó khăn tạm thời mà chỉ cần kiên trì, bạn sẽ vượt qua, nhưng cũng có thể đó là ngõ cụt mà dù có cố gắng thế nào thì bạn cũng không thay đổi được gì.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Theo Seth Godin, điểm khác biệt giữa những người thành công với những người bình thường là khả năng thoát khỏi điểm chết một cách ngoạn mục, đồng thời họ cũng là những kẻ “khó chơi” - sẽ đeo bám đến cùng nếu đó là mục tiêu thật sự xứng đáng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Người chiến thắng là người biết từ bỏ nhanh gọn, dứt khoát, không hối tiếc ngay khi phát hiện điểm dừng xứng tầm. Thực tế, người chiến thắng là người chủ động săn lùng điểm thử thách chứ không để điểm thử thách chế ngự. Họ nhận ra rằng thử thách càng lớn, chiến thắng càng huy hoàng. Vì vậy họ biết rằng nếu trở thành người đứng đầu trong lĩnh vực chuyên môn của mình, họ sẽ nhận được những phần thưởng xứng đáng, những lợi ích lâu dài.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu có lúc bạn cảm thấy mất phương hướng, hay phải đứng trước những lựa chọn đầy chông chênh, thì đó chính là lúc bạn đối diện với điểm thử thách. Khi đó, hoặc là bạn dám mạnh dạn từ bỏ tất cả để đi tìm cho mình một điểm thử thách xứng đáng được chinh phục, hoặc bạn sẽ bị kẹt lại trong một ma trận không lối thoát.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Dù bạn là ai và đang hoạt động trong lĩnh vực nào đi nữa thì trong trường hợp bạn phải đối diện với điểm thử thách, cuốn sách nhỏ này sẽ tiếp thêm động lực để bạn vượt qua điểm thử thách hứa hẹn nhiều phần thưởng giá trị về sau. Còn nếu đó là một điểm thử thách không đáng để bạn phải hao tâm tổn sức, cuốn sách sẽ giúp bạn có thêm dũng khí để từ bỏ, để rồi bạn sẽ gặt hái thành công ở một sân chơi khác.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Seth Godin không giúp bạn đưa ra đáp án cho mọi tình huống, mà ông sẽ hướng dẫn bạn cách đặt những câu hỏi giá trị để có những quyết định đúng đắn.</p>', '2011-07-14', 0, 352, 1, 24, 'NXB Trẻ', 'null', 120, 3, 29000, 36000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/diem-thu-thach-a.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Ngày nào tôi cũng nhắc bản thân mình nhớ đến câu nói trong đạo Do Thái rằng mọi bậc cha mẹ đều phải dạy con mình học bơi - tôi đã áp dụng triết lý này bằng cách để các con gái mình leo lên những thân cây thật cao, dùng những con dao sắc nhọn, nấu ăn với chiếc chảo nóng và tất nhiên, vì tôi sống ở Nam California, dạy chúng bơi, nhảy từ trên cao và lặn xuống những vùng nước sâu ngay từ khi chúng còn rất nhỏ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi tôi phát hành cuốn sách đầu tiên, các con tôi mới 9 và 13 tuổi. Tôi đã hoàn toàn tự tin khi nghĩ đến quãng thời gian chúng bắt đầu trưởng thành. Khi các con gái tôi bước vào tuổi mới lớn, tôi đã là một chuyên gia. Thật thế. Tôi là một nhà tâm lý học xã hội, có nghĩa rằng tôi được đào tạo bài bản để nhìn nhận các vấn đề liên quan đến cảm xúc trong từng bối cảnh văn hóa cụ thể. Chuyên ngành của tôi là nuôi dạy con cái và sự phát triển bình thường của trẻ. Tôi đã làm việc với các gia đình trong suốt 30 năm liền. Tôi hiểu về các học thuyết liên quan đến vấn đề cá tính hóa, tác động của tuổi dậy thì đến tính cách, nhịp điệu sinh lý hàng ngày phá vỡ giấc ngủ như thế nào và khao khát phiêu lưu mạo hiểm ở tuổi mới lớn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tôi cũng ý thức rất rõ về tác động của nền văn hóa vận động nhanh chóng, đầy cạnh tranh, thô bạo cùng sự phát triển của công nghệ Internet đến việc phát triển một nhân cách tốt ở giới trẻ. Tôi đồng thời rất chú ý đến việc trẻ mới lớn rất dễ bị tổn thương bởi sự lo lắng, thói quen ăn uống bừa bãi, tình trạng tự làm bản thân bị thương, sự thất vọng, các vấn đề liên quan đến học tập, sự chú ý cũng như việc lạm dụng thuốc. Tôi hình dung rằng với hàng tá những bí quyết liên quan đến chuyên môn cũng như tôn giáo, tôi sẽ dẫn các con gái mình vượt qua tất cả những mối nguy hiểm thường thấy của tuổi mới lớn. Và khi bước qua ngưỡng tuổi đó, các con gái tôi sẽ trở thành những con người có trách nhiệm, trưởng thành và là những thành viên gia đình tốt hơn. Dưới sự hướng dẫn chín chắn của tôi, chúng tôi sẽ có những mối quan tâm chung và những cuộc trò chuyện sâu sắc hơn. Vòng quay cuộc sống thường nhật của gia đình tôi cũng sẽ trơn tru hơn khi giờ đây các thành viên trong gia đình đã cao lớn, thông minh, ăn rơ với nhau và sáng tạo hơn."</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Xin giới thiệu với bạn đọc những lời khen tặng dành cho cuốn sách <strong>Dạy con kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ</strong>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong><em>“Giọng văn đầy cảm thông của Mogel trong cuốn sách hữu ích này có thể sẽ là cứu cánh cho các vị phụ huynh.”- Nhật báo Người Do Thái“Đây là cuốn sách gối đầu giường cho tất cả các bậc phụ huynh, dù họ theo tôn giáo nào… <strong>Dạy trẻ kiểu Do Thái - Sự may mắn của điểm B trừ </strong>cho độc giả thấy họ đang có rất nhiều điều may mắn.<strong> Mogel</strong> đã cố gói ghém rất nhiều lời khuyên thông thái trong khuôn khổ một cuốn sách.”</em><strong>- Nhật báo Người Do Thái ở San Diego</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>“Cuốn sách đầy những nội dung sâu sắc về việc làm sao để nuôi dạy nên được những thanh thiếu niên niên kiên cường.

Cuốn sách được tạm chia thành các chương riêng biệt để độc giả tiện theo dõi nên không theo thứ tự thời gian.</p>  <p class="Normal1" style="text-align: justify;">Gia đình Phật tử là một trong những thành trì cuối cùng mà chúng ta còn giữ được. Gia đình Phật tử có mặt cũng là để bảo vệ cho con em của ta, để ta đừng bị mất mát, đừng đi vào con đường tan rã. Gia đình Phật tử nằm giữa hai bên và có thế đứng cũng như sứ mệnh của nó. Một bên là học đường, một bên là gia đình. Gia đình Phật tử cũng được cấu tạo bởi những thành viên giống như những gia đình khác. Trong đó có người lớn đóng vai trò phụ huynh và có người nhỏ đóng vai trò con em. Mỗi đoàn sinh của Gia đình Phật tử đều có hai gia đình: gia đình tâm linh là Gia đình Phật tử và gia đình huyết thống. Hai gia đình này hỗ trợ cho nhau và sự tu tập của gia đình tâm linh sẽ đem lại nhiều lợi lạc cho gia đình huyết thống của đoàn sinh.</p>  <p class="Normal1" style="text-align: justify;">Tất cả chúng ta đều biết rằng mục đích của Gia đình Phật tử là để nuôi dưỡng đạo đức của mỗi đoàn sinh từ Oanh vũ cho đến Huynh trưởng. Nuôi dưỡng đạo đức để cải thiện nếp sống gia đình, cải thiện nếp sống học đường và cải thiện nếp sống xã hội. Chúng ta phải có một đường lối giáo dục rõ ràng mới có thể làm được điều đó. Ai cũng biết điều đó, nhưng thực sự thì chúng ta đã và đang làm được gì, nhất là trong khi chúng ta rất lẻ loi, không có sự yểm trợ của học đường, không có sự yểm trợ của gia đình? Làm thế nào để có một thế liên kết giữa Gia đình Phật tử và gia đình huyết thống cũng như giữa Gia đình Phật tử với học đường?</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khi một cái cây đã già cỗi thì chúng ta phải biết phương pháp làm cho cái cây đó mạnh mẽ trở lại. Một cái cây có thể có nhiều gốc rễ và nếu chất liệu dinh dưỡng trong lòng đất không đầy đủ thì chúng ta phải làm sao để tăng cường, để bồi dưỡng chất liệu dinh dưỡng đó? Nếu một vài cái rễ dưới đất mà tìm ra được một vùng đất mới có nhiều chất dinh dưỡng thì chính những cái rễ đó sẽ đi xa để mang dinh dưỡng về cho toàn cây và sẽ đem lại sinh lực mới cho cây. Cây là tượng trưng cho một thực tại sinh động, luôn luôn chuyển biến và lớn lên. Khi cái cây ngừng lớn là bắt đầu thoái hóa. Vì vậy ta phải làm mọi cách có thể để cho cái cây Gia đình Phật tử tiếp tục lớn mạnh, đừng để cho nó bị thoái hóa.</p>  <p class="Normal1"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span lang="EN-US">Trích đoạn hay:</span></span></em></strong></p>  <p class="Normal1"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>  <p class="Normal1"><strong><em><span lang="EN-US">Một niềm tin chung </span></em></strong></p>  <p class="Normal1"><span lang="EN-US">Trên con đường về Đạo Tràng Thanh Sơn sau khi mãn khóa tu ở Omega Institute tại tiểu bang New York, tôi thấy một pano quảng cáo như thế này: “Có vấn đề hả? Tại sao không thử cầu nguyện đi?” Và cách đó không xa có một pano khác viết: “Gia đình nào biết cầu nguyện chung thì không tan rã”. Chắc chắn là nhà thờ nào đó đã dựng lên hai tấm bảng ấy. Đó là sự thực tập của những người Tin Lành và những người Cơ Đốc. Họ tin rằng nếu trong gia đình mà mọi người cùng quỳ xuống cầu nguyện thì gia đình đó có cơ hội không bị tan rã, không bị chia năm xẻ bảy. Bởi vậy, tấm bảng đó có ý nói rằng nếu trong gia đình quý vị có những sự lộn xộn, chia rẽ, khổ đau thì quý vị phải thực tập cầu nguyện với nhau mỗi ngày. Cầu nguyện Thượng Đế, cầu nguyện Mẹ Maria, cầu nguyện Chúa Kitô, và phương pháp cầu nguyện có thể gọi là phương pháp gần như duy nhất để thực tập trong giáo lý của Cơ Đốc giáo. Và khi tất cả mọi người trong gia đình có chung một đối tượng để cầu nguyện thì những khó khăn, những khổ đau của gia đình đó cũng sẽ giảm bớt. Gia đình đó có cơ hội được lành lặn và không bị tan rã. Tôi thấy có một phần sự thật trong các phát ngôn ấy. Tại vì khi chúng ta cùng có một niềm tin và biết cùng nhìn về một hướng thì gia đình chúng ta có nhiều cơ hội để tồn tại hơn mà không bị tan vỡ hay chia rẽ. Chúng ta thuộc về truyền thống đạo Bụt, chúng ta cũng có những phương pháp thực tập như tụng kinh, hộ niệm, niệm Bụt. Chúng ta cũng tin tưởng rằng nếu chúng ta biết tập họp gia đình lại để cùng tụng kinh, cùng niệm Bụt thì chúng ta sẽ có cơ hội hàn gắn lại những đổ vỡ, thiết lập lại truyền thông trong gia đình và giữ cho gia đình không bị tan rã. Nhưng ngoài phương pháp tụng kinh, niệm Bụt và hộ niệm ra còn có rất nhiều phương pháp khác mà nếu học được, nắm vững được thì chúng ta sẽ thành công hơn trong sự duy trì liên hệ gia đình và giúp cho gia đình chúng ta được vững chãi và hạnh phúc. Đức Thế Tôn đã dạy rất nhiều pháp môn, chỉ cần mang một vài pháp môn đó ra để thực tập thì chúng ta đã có thể thiết lập được sự vững chãi, sự toàn vẹn của gia đình mình.</span></p>  <p class="Normal1"><span lang="EN-US">Trở về để khám phá Cấu trúc của gia đình Việt Nam có khác với cấu trúc của gia đình Bắc Mỹ, nhưng khi chúng ta đã rời quê hương để sang đó sinh sống thì chúng ta bắt đầu bị ảnh hưởng lối sống của người Bắc Mỹ. Vì vậy chúng ta cũng bắt đầu có những vấn đề như người Bắc Mỹ. Tôi nhớ hồi đồng bào mới bắt đầu di cư sang phương Tây, ở châu Âu cũng như ở châu Mỹ, con cái của chúng ta học rất giỏi ở các trường tiểu học. Các cháu đứng đầu lớp là chuyện thường. Nhưng sự kiện đó chỉ kéo dài được năm hoặc sáu năm thôi và sau đó việc học của các cháu bắt đầu đi xuống. Nhìn cho kỹ thì ta thấy rằng, ban đầu, cấu trúc của gia đình còn rất vững nên em bé an tâm và thành công trong sự học tập. Nhưng khi gia đình bắt đầu bị lung lay, bị ảnh hưởng bởi nếp sống phương Tây, khi người cha, người mẹ, người anh, người chị có những khổ đau mới, cộng với những khổ đau của người xa xứ, thì em bé mất chỗ nương tựa vững chãi từ gia đình, vì vậy em bé không còn học giỏi nữa. Điều này nếu quý vị học về xã hội học, nhân chủng học hoặc từng lưu tâm tới thì quý vị cũng trông thấy. Một vị dược sĩ hành nghề ở Canada cho tôi biết rằng ban đầu thanh niên Việt Nam không vướng vào vòng ma túy và không cần đến thuốc ngủ hay thuốc an thần. Những người mua thuốc ngủ và thuốc an thần. </span></p>  <p class="Normal1"><span lang="EN-US">toàn là người phương Tây. Nhưng chừng sáu bảy năm sau thì đồng bào ta bắt đầu tới mua thuốc ngủ và thuốc an thần. Điều đó cho thấy rằng chúng ta đã chịu ảnh hưởng bởi lối sống của xã hội phương Tây. Nếp sống tâm linh, nếp sống tinh thần cũng như nếp sống gia đình của chúng ta đã bị ảnh hưởng một cách nặng nề và chúng ta bắt đầu khổ đau, những khổ đau của người phương Tây, cộng thêm những khổ đau đã có sẵn. Trước đó cấu trúc gia đình của người Việt khá vững chãi nhưng sau đó đã từ từ bị lung lay và những chuyện như cha từ con, vợ bỏ chồng hay vợ chồng ly dị nhau bắt đầu xảy ra ở những gia đình người Việt. Ai mà không có ước muốn giữ cho gia đình mình được nguyên vẹn và hạnh phúc? Thế mà mấy ai trong chúng ta làm được chuyện đó, có thể giữ cho gia đình mình được toàn vẹn, hòa thuận và thương yêu? Nếu chúng ta không trở về để khám phá ra những nguyên tắc đạo lý, những phương pháp thực tập ở trong truyền thống tâm linh của chúng ta thì chúng ta không có cách gì để cứu vãn được tình trạng của bản thân và của gia đình. Người trẻ Việt Nam sống ở hải ngoại bây giờ cũng lâm vào tình trạng của người trẻ ngoại quốc và chúng ta không có phương tiện nào để bảo vệ chúng ta cả. Chúng ta nói rằng chúng ta theo đạo Bụt, chúng ta có nếp sống tâm linh. Nhưng điều đó chỉ có thể đúng một phần thôi, nhất là trên phương diện danh từ và lý thuyết. Trên phương diện hình thức, chúng ta là con của Bụt, là học trò, là đệ tử của thầy... Đúng như vậy. Chúng ta có chùa tổ ở Việt Nam và chúng ta cũng có ngôi chùa thứ hai ở trong thành phố của chúng ta. Nhưng chưa chắc điều này đã đúng trên phương diện nội dung. Tại vì có thể chúng ta cũng còn cảm thấy bơ vơ, chúng ta cũng không có những phương tiện để bảo vệ bản thân và gia đình của chúng ta...</span></p>', '2016-10-14', 0, NULL, 16, 28, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 376, 1, 76000, 95000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/dao-phat-cua-tuoi-tre.u547.d20161005.t154155.402776.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Và cuốn Tự Truyện này ra đời, như một lời chính thức minh giải cho chị sau gần ba thập kỷ - và - sau cùng - chị cảm thấy nhẹ lòng sau khi trút được gánh nặng "ngàn cân". Và tất cả đắng cay, đau đớn, tủi nhục đi theo chị suốt một quãng đời cũng chỉ Để Gió Cuốn Đi  mà không tự vấn mình, không oán trách một ai - như một ca khúc của cố nhạc sĩ Trịnh Công Sơn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Để Gió Cuốn Đi</strong> là cuốn tự truyện không quá nhiều chất văn nhưng vô cùng hình tượng, không nhiều mỹ từ lấp lánh mà rất hấp dẫn, say mê, lôi cuốn lòng người bởi những dòng viết tuôn chảy từ trái tim - ộc mạc - chân thật - sau sắc - lắng đọng, trái ngược với vẻ đẹp kiêu sa, thánh thiện, ngời sáng nơi chị. Người đọc càng bất ngờ hơn khi hiểu được một người Nghệ sỹ tài sắc vẹn toàn, danh tiếng như chị lại có thể có những năm tháng trầm luân, khổ hạnh đến tuyệt vọng - tới mức không thể tin nổi như vậy!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trên ba trăm trang viết tưởng chừng không thể gói hết tất cả những ký ức buồn vui, vinh quanh và khổ tủi của trên 60 năm trải nghiệm, hơn 40 năm mang tiếng hát cho đời và gần 30 năm xa xứ của chị... nhưng <strong>Để gió cuốn đi</strong> đã thực sự khơi lại trong trái tim người đọc một không gian rộng mở của hoài niệm, kỷ niệm một thời, để riêng dành cho suy ngẫm và nhận định của mỗi người. Cuốn tự truyện còn cho chúng ta sống lại những năm tháng lịch sử rất chân thật một thời hào hùng của cuộc chiến giải phóng dân tộc. Không ai có thể quên được nghệ sĩ Ái Vân đã thể hiện rất xuất sắc vai nữ giao liên xinh đẹp, dũng cảm trong bộ phim nổi tiếng "Chị Nhung" mà bất cứ ai ở Hà Nội và các tỉnh phía Bắc hồi đó có thể quên được. Cuốn sách như những thước phim quay chậm, tái hiện sống động những ký ức và cảm xúc Sài Gòn những ngày sau giải phóng, cuộc sống nghệ sĩ bi hài thời bao cấp, chiến tranh biên giới Tây Nam và tinh thần cuộc chiến tranh chống quân Trung Quốc xâm lược các tỉnh phía Bắc 17/2/1979  với ca khúc thao thức lòng người "Hãy cho tôi lên đường" mà chị đã thể hiện xuất sắc - đã động viên tinh thần những người chiến sĩ lên đường bảo vệ tổ quốc. Từng trang sách làm chúng ta càng thêm hiểu, cảm thông và yêu mến chị hơn. Đọc những trang viết của chị, trong tim mỗi một chúng ta sống lại tiếng hát trong trẻo, ngọt ngào và trẻ trung của chị với những ca khúc bất hủ một thời: "Bài ca xây dựng", "Triệu đóa hồng đỏ thắm", "Tổ quốc yêu thương", "Hãy cho tôi lên đường", "Mặt trời chưa bao giờ mọc như thế"...</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nhưng thật bất ngờ và thú vị - điểm khác biệt nổi bật nhất – so với tất cả những cuốn tự truyện khác - ở Việt Nam, và ngay cả trên thế giới - được bạn đọc quan tâm nhất lại không phải là những trang sách có chữ - mà là những trang sách bị xóa trắng trên nền biển bão tố, bắt đầu từ trang 242 và kết thúc ở trang 248 với hình nền cơn lốc xoáy để bắt đầu phần 15 -VƯỢT BIÊN. Những trang này thể hiện cho 8.808 từ mà khi thực hiện cuốn sách này, nghệ sĩ Ái Vân đã quyết định không xới lại nỗi đau đớn nhất của chị - và - có thể ảnh hưởng đến những người liên quan. Đây chính là phần mà người đọc lắng đọng lại nhiều nhất và tưởng tượng những biến cố khủng khiếp nào đã ập xuống cuộc đời khiến chị không còn đường nào khác, không còn nơi ẩn nấp an toàn... phải quyết định trốn chạy khỏi tổ quốc, nơi chôn nhau cắt rốn và những người ruột thịt của mình. Không ai có thể không dừng lại suy nghĩ khi đọc 8 dòng duy nhất đầy ý nghĩa mà chị đã viết cho phần này:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Tôi đã cố gắng viết cho xong mục này - 8.808 từ cả thảy. Câu chuyện tôi chưa từng kế ra này cho biết lý do vì sao tôi buộc phải rời Tổ quốc năm 1990 khi tôi đang được nhà nước có nhiều ưu ái. Nhưng vì câu chuyện quá đau đớn, khi đọc lại tôi không thể chịu nổi. Con trai tôi - nếu đọc được phần này - chắc chắn cũng sẽ không chịu nổi. Vì thế - sau nhiều đêm suy nghĩ - tôi xin lỗi bạn đọc - cho phép tôi được xóa trắng mục này!"</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Vâng! Tất cả chúng ta đều ước mong những năm tháng dằn vặt, đau đớn, tủi hận của chị - hay của bất kỳ ai khác, đã từng gánh chịu - sẽ Để Gió Cuốn Đi - còn lại là - những năm tháng đầy ấm áp, yêu thương!</p>', '2016-04-14', 0, 244, 1, 30, 'NXB Hội Nhà Văn', 'null', 335, 8, 134000, 168000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/aivan-tutruyen1.u319.d20160430.t140636.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Cùng với những câu chuyện nhỏ thú vị của người mẹ là lời khuyên mang tính chuyên môn, giải đáp cụ thể từ bác sỹ <strong>Nguyễn Trí Đoàn</strong>, giúp hóa giải những hiểu lầm từ kinh nghiệm dân gian được truyền lại, cũng như lý giải một cách khoa học những thông tin chưa đúng đắn đang được lưu truyền hiện nay, mang đến góc nhìn đúng đắn nhất cho mỗi hiện tượng, sự việc với những kiến thức y khoa hiện đại được cập nhật liên tục. Cuốn sách sẽ giúp các bậc phụ huynh trang bị một số kiến thức cơ bản trong việc chăm sóc trẻ một cách khoa học và góp phần giúp các mẹ và những-người-sẽ-là-mẹ trở nên tự tin hơn trong việc chăm con, xua tan đi những lo lắng, để mỗi em bé ra đời đều được hưởng sự chăm sóc tốt nhất.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trên thị trường có nhiều đầu sách về chăm sóc trẻ, tuy nhiên đa phần đều là nội dung được dịch từ các sách nước ngoài nên phần nào đó không phù hợp với các gia đình Việt bởi sự khác biệt về suy nghĩ và ý thức hệ cùng những quan niệm sống. Đặc biệt là các cuốn sách ấy không bao giờ nhắc tới cách xử lý các vấn đề đời thường, những kinh nghiệm dân gian hay phương pháp chăm sóc trẻ từ “kinh nghiệm cá nhân” của các mẹ tràn lan trên các diễn đàn và mạng xã hội - những điều đang tồn tại trong xã hội Việt ta hiện nay. Do đó,<strong> Để con được ốm</strong> trở thành một tác phẩm độc đáo khi đi sâu vào vấn đề chăm sóc con trẻ cùng những điều bất cập trong xã hội Việt, trong những gia đình Việt, giữa các thành viên trong gia đình. <strong>Để con được ốm</strong> không phải là cuốn “bách khoa toàn thư” chữa bách bệnh ở trẻ em, nó đơn giản là lời sẻ chia và động viên gửi đến các bà mẹ trẻ nói riêng và các gia đình nói chung.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hi vọng, cuốn sách sẽ khiến các bậc phụ huynh cảm thấy như một luồng gió mát giúp “cởi phăng”, “cuốn bay” những suy nghĩ, những định kiến không đúng như những lớp áo giáp vững chắc về hiều biết, về cách chăm sóc trẻ khi bệnh cũng như khi khỏe.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Nhận xét</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">“Khi cầm cuốn sách trên tay, tôi cảm thấy hết sức thú vị vì nội dung của nó đã gạt bỏ hầu hết mọi quan niệm về chăm sóc trẻ theo “kinh nghiệm” truyền tai của các bà mẹ - nuôi con nhìn sang nhà hàng xóm. Đặc biệt hơn, nó được tổng kết từ thực tế chăm sóc con của một bà mẹ trẻ. Những rắc rối hết sức đời thường tưởng như nhỏ nhặt ấy đã được giải đáp và phân tích một cách cặn kẽ bằng các chứng cứ khoa học và những lời khuyên cũng hết sức đời thường.”</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Bs. Ngô Đức Hùng, Bệnh viện Bạch Mai)</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Từ giây phút đầu tiên cầm quyển sách trên tay, tôi biết rằng quyển sách này sẽ tạo ra sự thay đổi trong nhận thức của cha mẹ Việt về cách chữa trị bằng trái tim yêu thương, thay vì việc chữa trị thông thường thông qua các biểu hiện bệnh lý."</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Mrs. Jeannie Chan-Ho, Viện trưởng Viện Giáo dục Shichida Việt Nam)</strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">"Sức khỏe của con luôn là mối quan tâm hàng đầu của mẹ. Chỉ cần con hắt hơi thôi là lo lắng có phải bệnh không? Khi con bệnh, mình chăm sóc sao đây? Sao tháng này con tăng ký ít vậy? Phát triển vậy có bình thường không? Có suy dinh dưỡng không? Hôm nay con ăn có vài muỗng, sao đủ chất? Bao nhiêu lo lắng, từ lớn đến nhỏ đều được Bác sĩ Trí Đoàn giải thích rõ ràng, dễ hiểu và mang tính khoa học. Nhiều kinh nghiệm dân gian chưa đúng cũng được mổ xẻ, phân tích giúp các mẹ hiểu cái gì nên giữ lại, cái gì nên điều chỉnh cho đúng. Thậm chí, những người trong ngành y như tôi cũng được cập nhật những kiến thức cũ thành mới. Có thể nói, chưa quyển sách nào làm đươc điều này. Tôi tin Để con được ốm là một quyển sách đáng để gối đầu giường cho các bà mẹ, giúp các mẹ tự tin chăm sóc bé yêu một cách tốt nhất!"</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>(Bs.

Đó chính là sự biểu trưng hoàn hảo cho con đường huyền thoại xa xưa. Sau hai tháng dọc theo Con đường tơ lụa, tôi đã có những trải nghiệm đáng nhớ trong đời. Từ Kuwait, Iran của "vùng đất lửa" Trung Đông đến những đất nước gần như biệt lập ở Trung Á như Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, và hàng loạt các điểm đến xa xôi mà đoàn thương nhân năm xưa đã phải trải qua với biết bao nhiêu câu chuyện huyền bí, ly kỳ. Và tôi, cũng trên Con đường tơ lụa năm nào, đã lang thang qua bao nhiêu làng mạc, thị trấn heo hút không bóng người, tận mắt chứng kiến những công trình kiến trúc cổ có tuổi đời hàng trăm thậm chí hàng ngàn năm, may mắn tham dự những lễ hội truyền thống của địa phương, được đắm mình với cuộc sống cư dân bản địa ở Trung Đông hay khắp các nẻo đường Trung Á. Quyển sách ra đời sau chuyến đi mười tháng, trong đó có bốn tháng tôi phải miệt mài vẫy bút để lưu lại những kỷ niệm tuyệt vời trong hành trình ấy.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Quyển sách không viết theo kiểu tư liệu nghiên cứu lịch sử mà là quyển sách về du ký. Hành trình của chuyến đi sẽ được đúc kết thành những câu chuyện thông qua cảm xúc, nhận định về các vùng đất nằm trên vành đai Con đường tơ lụa. Tuy nhiên lịch sử lại là yếu tố quan trọng tạo nên sự biến đổi về văn hóa, tôn giáo, phong tục tập quán, kiến trúc và kể cả con người từng chịu ảnh hưởng bởi con đường giao thương cổ này và tôi đã sử dụng một số tư liệu lịch sử để người đọc dễ dàng hình dung hơn. Thông tin lịch sử được tôi ghi chép lại trong quá trình trò chuyện cùng các nhân vật, những tài liệu thu thập trên internet và những so sánh, nhận định và nhận xét mang tính chủ quan.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu các bạn chưa có dịp đặt chân trên Con đường tơ lụa, hãy tìm một điểm tựa và cùng tôi phiêu lưu qua những trang sách này. Ở đó, có những câu chuyện trải nghiệm về cuộc sống con người, về vùng đất qua nhiều đổi thay từ những thăng trầm của lịch sử và trên hết là những thử thách của bản thân trong suốt hành trình khám phá đơn độc.

Khi nắm được ngôn ngữ của cơ thể, người đọc có thể hiểu rằng, những người dối trá thường chỉ có thể giả vờ trong một thời gian ngắn, vì dáng vẻ bề ngoài sẽ vô tình "tố cáo" những gì họ che giấu.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nếu bạn biết rèn cho mình khả năng quan sát hoạt động giao tiếp của con người, thậm chí chỉ trong cách bắt tay như thế nào cho hiệu quả, bạn sẽ thấy thành công trong giao tiếp tự nhiên đến với mình. Khi một người có thể sử dụng tốt ngôn ngữ cơ thể họ, điều đó chứng tỏ rằng họ hiểu rõ bản thân, biết cách hiểu người khác và họ tự tin. Vì thế, phần lớn các nhân vật danh tiếng đều là những "bậc thày" về sử dụng ngôn ngữ cơ thể. Ngoài ra, cuốn sách còn cung cấp cho người đọc nhiều kiến thức thú vị về sự khác biệt trong giao tiếp giữa con người với con người đến từ các quốc gia khác nhau.</p>', '2014-08-14', 0, 11, 39, 27, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'Lê Huy Lâm', 456, 1, 178000, 198000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/ngon_ngu_1.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Lý do, theo các tác giả, là vì con người dễ bị tác động bởi nhiều định kiến khác nhau, mà lắm lúc chúng làm ta trở nên thật ngớ ngẩn.</p>  <p>Thaler và Sunstein mời chúng ta bước vào thế giới của những lựa chọn, một thế giới xem nhân tính là một vật phẩm được ban tặng.</p>  <p>Các tác giả cho thấy bằng cách tìm hiểu suy nghĩ của người khác, chúng ta có thể thiết kế các môi trường lựa chọn giúp họ dễ dàng tìm được những gì tốt nhất cho mình. Sử dụng nhiều ví dụ sống động từ những mặt quan trọng nhất trong đời sống, Thaler và Sunstein cho chúng ta thấy làm thế nào một” kiến trúc lựa chọn” tinh tường có thể hích con người theo những hướng có lợi mà không hạn chế quyền tự do lựa chọn của chúng ta.</p>  <p>Đây là một trong những cuốn sách hấp dẫn và kích thích tư duy sáng tạo nhất trong những năm gần đây.</p>  <p>“Cú hích” rất có giá trị và tạo nên sự khác biệt sâu sắc.

Điều đó đồng nghĩa với việc anh có rất ít hy vọng để sống một cuộc đời bình thường. Người mẹ và người cha thân yêu của anh lần đầu nhìn thấy con trai đã sốc kinh khủng. Sự ra đời của Nick đã làm chao đảo cả cuộc sống của một gia đình trẻ. Họ khó có thể chấp nhận được sự thật đau lòng về đứa con bé bỏng; không chỉ vô cùng đau khổ, họ còn hết sức lo lắng cho tương lai của con trai.</p>  <p>Lớn lên, bắt đầu ý thức về thân phận của mình cũng là lúc Nick chỉ muốn biến mất khỏi cuộc sống. Như anh từng tâm sự: “Hoàn cảnh nghiệt ngã tưởng đã có lúc nhấn chìm tôi. Hơn ai hết, tôi từng muốn tự tử, và đã từng rất nhiều lần định bỏ cuộc. Nhưng cuối cùng, tôi đã can đảm đứng dậy sau hàng ngàn lần ngã…”<br />Điều gì đã khiến Nick đứng dậy và đi qua tất cả? Đó thật sự là một điều kỳ diệu lớn lao – Khát vọng sống mãnh liệt và ý chí quật cường chiến thắng số phận.</p>  <p>“Thường thì chúng ta cứ tự nhủ rằng mình không đủ thông minh hoặc không đủ hấp dẫn hoặc không đủ tài năng để theo đuổi những ước mơ. Chúng ta tin những gì người khác nói về chúng ta,hoặc tự đặt ra những giới hạn cho bản thân mình. Tồi tệ hơn, khi bạn tự coi mình là một người vô giáaacute; trị có nghĩa là bạn đang đặt ra giới hạn cho những điều kỳ diệu mà Chúa có thể trao gửi cho bạn!”-(Nick Vujicic)</p>  <p>“Từ sâu thẳm trái tim mình, tôi tin rằng cuộc đời không có bất cứ giới hạn nào hết. Cho dù những thách thức mà bạn đang phải đối mặt là gì đi nữa, cho dù những thách thức ấy có khốc liệt, nghiệt ngã đến mức nào chăng nữa, tôi cũng mong bạn hãy tin tưởng và cảm thấy như vậy về cuộc sống của chính mình…” - (Nick Vujicic)</p>  <p>Nick đã và đang sống để chứng minh chân lý lớn lao: <strong>Không có giới hạn</strong> nào lớn hơn sự tự giới hạn chính mình. Chỉ cần nhắc tới cái tên Nick Vujicic, hàng triệu người trên toàn cầu đã có thể bật khóc vì xúc động và cảm phục. Nick đã trở thành một ân phúc thật sự cho những ai được tiếp xúc với anh, hoặc từng biết đến anh qua sách, báo, băng đĩa, internet…</p>  <p>Không có tay, Nick Vujicic vẫn chạm tới trái tim của hàng triệu người mỗi khi hiện diện. Không có chân, Nick vẫn đi tới khắp mọi nơi trên toàn thế giới. Hiện tại, Nick là Chủ tịch và là CEO của tổ chức quốc tế Life Without Limbs, là giám đốc công ty Attitude Is Altitude, đồng thời là một diễn giả có sức truyền cảm lớn nhất và đặc biệt nhất hành tinh.</p>  <p>“Là đứa con của Chúa, bạn chắc chắn đẹp đẽ và quý giá hơn tất cả những viên kim cương trên thế gian này. Bạn và tôi cực kỳ thích hợp để trở thành những con người mà đấng sáng tạo ra chúng ta muốn chúng ta trở thành! Dẫu vậy, chúng ta nên luôn luôn đặt ra cho mình mục tiêu trở thành những con người tốt hơn, toàn thiện hơn, đẩy lùi và loại bỏ những giới hạn bằng cách mơ những giấc mơ lớn lao.

Phương thức gắn kết duy nhất giữa hai người là những chiếc đĩa bài nói chuyện và chương trình tấu hài Rokugo được truyền tay nhau cùng những lá thư hồi âm đã giúp tình cảm của cả hai nở rộ từ lúc nào chẳng hay.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bắt đầu từ những rung động nhẹ nhàng, những cuộc hạnh ngộ tình cờ, từng bí mật được Manae tiết lộ cho Daichan với sự tin tưởng tuyệt đối . Những tưởng trong lòng cả hai đã xác định sẽ dành cho nhau một chỗ đứng, ấy vậy mà cuộc đời vẫn có nhiều những bất ngờ chẳng thể nào lường trước được. Cơ hội để có nhau hay bỏ lỡ mất nhau trong đời, đôi khi chỉ cách ta trong gang tấc. Chắc hẳn đoạn kết của cuốn sách này sẽ làm bạn thỏa mãn khi lật giở đến những trang viết cuối cùng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với mạch văn chau chuốt và có chiều sâu, Yasushi rất tài tình khi xoa dịu những trái tim non nớt mới chạm ngõ cuộc đời đồng thời mang tới những bài học cuộc sống ý nghĩa của người từng trải , một món quà chẳng ai cho bạn nhiều, chi tiết và đầy đủ đến thế.. .

Nếu mỗi ngày bạn không ngủ đủ từ bảy đến tám tiếng đồng hồ, đời sống sẽ bị thun lại, óc không nở ra được. Ngủ đủ giúp cho bộ não sắp xếp lại, mềm dẻo hơn, giúp yếu tố tăng trưởng cao.

Dù ngoại cảnh có hỗn loạn đến đâu, dù thiên nhiên không ưu đãi cho họ nhiều điều kiện thuận lợi, Israel vẫn vươn lên mạnh mẽ qua biết bao hành trình khó khăn, khắc nghiệt từ những ngày đầu phục quốc cho đến khi xây dựng đời sống xã hội. Câu chuyện về "<a href="http://tiki.vn/quoc-gia-khoi-nghiep-p62455.html">Quốc gia khởi nghiệp</a>" Israel lại được kể tiếp trong những trang văn giản dị chứa đựng những thông điệp lớn lao trong tác phẩm "Con đường thoát hạn" - một anh hùng ca về "thung lũng Silicon" của thế giới.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Không giống như Việt Nam, Israel không sở hữu nguồn tài nguyên nước dồi dào và hệ thống sông ngòi, kênh rạch phong phú – mà ngược lại, có tới 60% diện tích là hoang mạc, lại bị bao vây ba bề bốn bên bởi những quốc gia thù địch. Thế nhưng, người Israel đã tìm ra cách tự “sản xuất” ra nước thông qua những biện pháp sáng tạo và liều lĩnh. Đó là Nước sạch được khử mặn từ nước biển, là nước lợ đã qua một hệ thống lọc phức tạp, thậm chí là nước thải sinh hoạt (nước cống) được xử lý tinh vi để có thể dùng tưới tiêu cho nông nghiệp hay cho những mục đích sinh hoạt thông thường khác... Năm 2013, người Israel đã tuyên bố : nguồn nước của họ không còn phụ thuộc vào thiên nhiên nữa ! Nước chính là cứu cánh, là phép màu mở ra cánh cửa nông nghiệp, kinh tế, ngoại giao cho Israel. Israel hiện sản xuất nước dư thừa cho nhu cầu nội tại và còn xuất khẩu đều đặn 24/7 sang cho các nước láng giềng, Palestine và Jordan, là vũ khí hòa bình của Israel cho tình trạng đối đầu Iran-Israel, Israel-Trung Quốc và một số các quốc gia khác, trở thành một « ngành kinh doanh toàn cầu », đòn bẩy cho kinh tế Israel phát triển.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bằng những nghiên cứu tỉ mỉ và với hàng trăm cuộc phỏng vấn, Siegel đã mô tả sinh động cách mà Israel đã vượt qua các cuộc khủng hoảng nước của riêng mình, biến bất lợi thành lợi thế, đồng thời hỗ trợ các quốc gia khác trong việc xử lý và bảo tồn nguồn nước. Với 12 chương sách được bố cục một cách khoa học, cuốn sách kể về cả một lịch sử và hành trình thần kỳ của Israel trong hành trình chinh phục thiên nhiên, mang đến cho bạn những góc nhìn bao quát, một tư duy nhất quán, là kim chỉ nam về một nền quản trị nước đầy trí tuệ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cũng như lời của Shimon Tal, nguyên chủ nhiệm Ủy ban Nước Israel đã nói: "Cách thức quản lý nước của một quốc gia nói lên nhiều điều về quốc gia đó.", đây là câu chuyện không chỉ dành cho những người nghiên cứu về thủy lợi và nông nghiệp, nó còn là câu chuyện dành cho tất cả những người quan tâm về việc kiến tạo một tương lai phát triển và bền vững cho đất nước.</p>', '2016-06-14', 0, 351, 9, 18, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', 504, 3, 119000, 149000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/con duong thoat han ban tieng viet.u2469.d20160823.t105118.805071.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Chính thứ tình cảm này đã kéo cô bé chim hải âu nhỏ gần lại với mèo Zorba, bởi “Thật dễ dàng để chấp nhận và yêu thương một kẻ nào đó giống mình, nhưng để yêu thương ai đó khác mình thực sự rất khó khăn..”. Vậy đấy, yêu thương là học cách chấp nhận sự khác biệt và không có ý định muốn biến người đó trở nên giống mình. Khi chúng ta yêu thương ai đó bằng tất cả sự chân thành, thì mọi định kiến và khác biệt chỉ là điểm tựa cho tình cảm cao đẹp trong loài mèo, loài người ấy được sâu sắc hơn thôi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Xem review sách: <a href="http://tiki.vn/tu-van/chuyen-con-meo-day-hai-au-bay-yeu-thuong-de-doi-thay">Chuyện con mèo dạy hải âu bay – yêu thương để đổi thay</a></strong></p>', '2014-03-14', 0, 209, 17, 8, 'NXB Hội Nhà Văn', 'null', 139, 7, 28000, 35000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/chuyen-con-meo-day-hai-au-bay.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Bỏ ngoài tai mọi lời chế giễu của những đồng loại đã quá quen với cuộc sống chậm chạp và lặng lẽ vốn có, kẻ “nổi loạn” quyết chí rời xa gia trang ô rô, lên đường kiếm tìm cho mình một cái tên riêng cùng lời giải đáp cho thắc mắc bấy lâu. Trên hành trình ấy, nó gặp một bác rùa già, người đã đặt cho nó cái tên “Dũng Khí” và chỉ cho nó thấy tận mắt một hiểm họa lớn đối với mọi loài sinh vật của đồng cỏ: con người!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chú ốc sên nhỏ quyết định quay về báo tin cho đồng loại, cùng với đó là cả nhà kiến, bọ hung, và chuột chũi… mà nó gặp trên đường. Chính nhờ sự chậm chạp và gan dạ, “Dũng Khí” đã giúp nhiều sinh vật thoát khỏi nguy hiểm, đồng thời dẫn dắt các anh em của mình vượt qua chặng đường gian khổ, tìm đến một Quê Hương Bồ Công Anh mới, an toàn và đầy hứa hẹn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chuyện con ốc sên muốn biết tại sao nó chậm chạp</strong> là một trong số các tác phẩm thú vị của<strong> Luis Sepúlveda</strong> dành cho độc giả mọi lứa tuổi, ra đời từ một câu hỏi bất ngờ của cậu cháu trai Daniel trong lúc quan sát một con ốc sên trong vườn nhà: “Ông ơi, tại sao ốc sên lại chậm chạp đến vậy?” Và câu chuyện về “Dũng Khí” - một chú ốc sên trẻ tuổi với một hành trình lưu vong, những cuộc gặp gỡ và sự dấn thân dù đau đớn nhưng vô cùng ý nghĩa đã được dựng lên. Với giọng kể trong sáng, nhẹ nhàng, <strong>Luis Sepúlveda</strong> mở ra trước mắt chúng ta một thế giới thiên nhiên gần gũi, sinh động, ẩn chứa một câu chuyện ngụ ngôn mang triết lý sâu xa về cuộc sống, về bản chất mỗi loài, lòng dũng cảm, khát vọng và nhu cầu khẳng định cái tôi.

Dưới tác động của khí hậu  nhiệt đới gió mùa, những sinh vật trong các khu rừng phát triển phong  phú hơn bao giờ hết, trong đó có vô số loài chim.<br /><br />Cuốn sách này thử  đưa ra những tiếp cận khác biệt với 5 loài trong số đó, mà phần lớn môi  trường sống của chúng tập trung ở các vùng rừng thuộc Nam Trung Bộ. Có  hay không sự hóa thân của “cô Tấm” trong truyền thuyết dân gian vào chim  Vàng Anh khăn mỏ quạ? Giống chim nào thể hiện tính “gia trưởng” điển  hình? Những loài chim nào chuyên sống bằng nghề trộm cắp? Và làm cách  nào bầy chim nhỏ bé có thể đào những chiếc hang sâu đến 1m để làm tổ  trên những bờ vực dựng đứng ven biển?

CHIẾN THẮNG TRÒ CHƠI CUỘC SỐNG</strong><br /><br /><em>Tôi Tài Giỏi, Bạn Cũng Thế! dành cho người trưởng thành</em><br /><br /><em>Quyển sách được chính tác giả Adam Khoo công nhận là quyển <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a> nhất mình từng viết</em><br /><br /><strong>Tác giả: Adam Khoo</strong><br /><br /><strong>Dịch giả: Uông Xuân Vy - Trần Đăng Khoa</strong><br /><br />Nhiều người nghĩ rằng người trưởng thành nghĩa là một người đã đạt đến một độ tuổi nhất định nào đó trong cuộc sống. Tuy nhiên, đó là định nghĩa cổ điển về mặt sinh học. Trong xã hội hiện đại ngày nay, nếu một người có nhiều tuổi nhưng vẫn sống dựa vào người khác, vẫn không nỗ lực tự phấn đấu, vẫn ỷ lại, chây lười, ăn bám,... thì liệu có khác gì một đứa trẻ. Một người như thế không thể được coi là một người có kinh nghiệm sống và càng không thể được coi là một người trưởng thành, mà chỉ đáng được gọi là một đứa trẻ có nhiều tuổi.<br /><br /><em>Kinh nghiệm sống và sự trưởng thành không phụ thuộc vào việc bạn đã sống bao lâu, mà phụ thuộc vào việc bao nhiêu năm qua bạn đã và đang sống như thế nào. </em></p>  <p><strong>Người trưởng thành là người:</strong><br /><br /> - Muốn làm chủ vận mệnh của mình, thay vì ỷ lại, chây lười, ăn bám, đổ lỗi cho số phận,...</p>  <p>- Muốn hoàn thành tốt công việc của mình để có một sự nghiệp rạng rỡ.</p>  <p>- Muốn biến những khó khăn thách thức thành cơ hội giúp mình thành công hơn.</p>  <p>- Muốn giữ vững vị thế và lợi thế cạnh tranh trong một thời đại mà sự cạnh tranh đang trở nên ngày một quyết liệt hơn.</p>  <p>- Muốn liên tục xây dựng và phát triển lòng tự trọng và sự tự tin của mình để ngẩng cao đầu mà sống.</p>  <p>- Muốn vượt lên trên bản thân và làm chủ những cảm xúc bên trong một cách hiệu quả.</p>  <p>- Muốn tạo ra vận may cho chính mình thay vì cầu mong vận may đến với mình.</p>  <p>- Muốn gặt hái những kết quả đột phá trong nhiều khía cạnh của cuộc sống như: gia đình, sự nghiệp, địa vị xã hội, các mối quan hệ,...</p>  <p>- Muốn có một cuộc sống không chỉ thành công mà còn hạnh phúc trọn vẹn.<br /><br />Nếu bạn mong muốn những thứ đó, chắc chắn bạn đã là một người trưởng thành cho dù bạn đang ở bất kỳ độ tuổi nào, thậm chí là một học sinh đi nữa, bởi vì thật sự có rất ít người đã biết mong muốn như trên ngay khi còn ngồi trên ghế nhà trường. Hơn thế nữa, một người trưởng thành không chỉ mong muốn, mà còn hành động. Hơn ai hết, những người trưởng thành hiểu rằng mong muốn suông thì rốt cuộc cũng chỉ là những giấc mơ mãi không thành hiện thực. Những người trưởng thành hành động và biết cách xem cuộc sống này như một trò chơi thú vị.<br /><br />Trong trò chơi ấy, có những người tham gia để thắng và cũng có rất nhiều người dường như "bị buộc phải tham gia", cho nên họ chỉ tham gia để "không bị thua". Nếu bạn là một trong số ít những người muốn chơi để thắng thì quyển sách <strong>Chiến Thắng Trò Chơi Cuộc Sống</strong> sẽ mang đến cho bạn những lợi thế cạnh tranh mạnh mẽ.<br /><br />Bạn sẽ phát hiện ra rằng, bất kỳ ai cũng có thể trở thành người chiến thắng trong trò chơi cuộc sống - để xuất sắc trong công việc, tận hưởng những mối quan hệ tốt đẹp, dư dả về tài chính và hạnh phúc dài lâu. Chỉ cần bạn tìm hiểu và áp dụng chiến lược của những người trưởng thành như bạn nhưng đã thành công tột bậc trong cuộc sống.<br /><br />Nếu bạn mong muốn nhiều điều và khao khát chiến thắng, đã đến lúc phải hành động! Hãy để <strong>Chiến Thắng Trò Chơi Cuộc Sống</strong> là người bạn đồng hành cùng bạn trên con đường vươn lên.</p>', '2013-01-14', 0, 5, 24, 25, 'NXB Phụ Nữ', 'null', 298, 9, 96000, 120000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/chien-thang-tro-choi-cuoc-song.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Hãy làm cho cạnh tranh trở nên cần thiết.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><strong>3.</strong> Đừng khai thác tiếp các nhu cầu hiện có. Hãy tạo ra và giành lấy các nhu cầu mới.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-size: small; color: #000000;"><strong>4. </strong>Đừng cố gắng cân bằng giá trị/chi phí. Hãy phá vỡ cân bằng giá trị/chi phí.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">5</span>.</strong></span> Đừng đặt toàn bộ hoạt động của công ty trong việc theo đuổi sự khác biệt hoặc theo đuổi chi phí thấp. Hãy đặt toàn bộ hoạt động của công ty trong chiến lược vừa theo đuổi sự khác biệt, đồng thời vừa theo đuổi chi phí thấp.</span></p>  <p><span style="font-size: small;">Bản chất của <em><strong>Chiến lược đại dương xanh</strong></em> là nâng cao về giá trị đi kèm với sự tiện lợi, giá cả thấp và giảm chi phí.

Hàng chục câu chuyện, hàng trăm con người, hàng ngàn thời điểm được nhắc đến ở đây xuyên suốt 20 năm chiến tranh Việt Nam, đặc biệt là trong giai đoạn 1961 – 1975, thậm chí, còn có những câu chuyện hậu chiến.</span></p>  <p><span style="color: #003366;">Không phải ngẫu nhiên mà Chân Trần, Chí Thép được đánh giá cao về mặt nội dung. Trong cuốn sách, cuộc chiến được đặc tả thông qua con người thật, sự kiện thật nhưng lại bằng quan điểm của một chiến binh đã từng đứng bên kia chiến tuyến. Khác biệt ngôn ngữ, khác biệt quan điểm, khác biệt lý tưởng ấy không biến những cảm xúc thành lạc điệu mà ngược lại, nó đồng cảm đến tận cùng, bởi, chiến tranh, dù thắng hay thua thì tổn thất là không thể đo đếm được. Có những gia đình không bao giờ có ngày đoàn tụ. Có những người mẹ vĩnh viễn mất đi những người con của mình. Có những chiến sĩ chiến đấu đến giây phút cuối cùng vì lý tưởng và niềm tin thống nhất đất nước.

Tràn ngập trong Chân Trần, Chí Thép là tinh thần hòa hợp hiếm có giữa những bên đã từng là kẻ thù thì nay là bạn. Tinh thần hòa hợp ấy từng bước góp phần chữa lành vết thương tinh thần của những con người, chủ động hoặc bị động, tham dự vào cuộc chiến, và rồi nó sẽ mở ra cánh cửa cho tương lai bằng nỗ lực khắc phục hậu quả chiến tranh, không chỉ với hàng trăm ngàn người còn mất tích, không chỉ với hàng triệu thương, bệnh binh, hàng triệu nạn nhân bị chất độc Cam dày vò.</span></p>  <p><span style="color: #003366;">Chân Trần, Chí Thép, vượt ra ngoài cái tên của nó, là một thông điệp hòa giải, là một cách nhìn nhận thẳng thắn về cuộc chiến, về con người, về Việt Nam.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium;">©</span></p>  <h2 class="Lead" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Từ những cuộc gặp gỡ với người dân cũng như các quân nhân Việt Nam sau chiến tranh, cựu trung tá thủy quân lục chiến James G.

Thông điệp ở đây là, chính quyết tâm của nhân dân và "quy mô" trái tim của họ, chứ không phải sức mạnh quân đội và quy mô của kho vũ khí, quyết định chiến thắng".</span></p>  <p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Bản dịch tiếng Việt tác phẩm này có tên <em>Chân trần, chí thép</em> do First News và NXB Tổng hợp TP HCM vừa xuất bản. Cuốn sách dày gần 400 trang, tập hợp thông tin từ gần 200 cuộc phỏng vấn do James G. Zumwalt thực hiện với các "cựu chiến binh Bắc Việt và Việt Cộng cũng như dân thường Việt Nam", theo cách nói của ông.

Zumwalt sinh ra trong gia đình có truyền thống binh nghiệp. Cha ông là đô đốc Elmo R. Zumwalt, Tư lệnh Hải quân Mỹ tại Việt Nam, và sau này là Tham mưu trưởng Hải quân Mỹ. Trong vai trò chỉ huy Hải quân Mỹ tại Việt Nam, bắt đầu vào năm 1968, Tư lệnh Elmo Zumwalt đã phát động chiến dịch rải chất độc màu da cam dọc các bờ sông ở miền Nam Việt Nam.</span></p>  <p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Nhiều chiến binh Mỹ trở về từ cuộc chiến cũng bị phơi nhiễm chất độc này, trong đó có người con trai cùng tên với ông là Elmo R.

Năm 1994, lần đầu tiên ông cùng cha - đô đốc Zumwalt - trở lại Việt Nam trong một chuyến đi tìm hiểu tác hại của chất độc màu da cam lên sức khỏe con người.</span></p>  <p class="Normal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chính từ chuyến đi ấy, ông Zumwalt được tiếp xúc với nhiều vị tướng lĩnh cấp cao, các cựu quân nhân từng tham gia cuộc chiến chống Mỹ cũng như những người dân thường. Sau đó, ông còn trở lại Việt Nam nhiều lần nữa. Zumwalt chia sẻ, mỗi chuyến đi, mỗi cuộc gặp cho ông một cái nhìn mới, một nhận thức mới về đất nước và con người ở đây. "Khi hiểu biết đơm mầm, lòng thù hận âm ỉ bấy lâu tan biến, thay vào đó là sự thông cảm, sẻ chia.

Hãy so sánh trẻ em với những loài động vật khác trong thế giới tự nhiên. Khi chúng được sinh ra, chúng đã có những bản năng cơ bản như có thể tự đi lại, có thể tự bơi sau một vài giờ đồng hồ.

Nguyên nhân dẫn đến tình trạng này là lối sống thiếu lành mạnh, thực phẩm không an toàn, môi trường sống ô nhiễm. Theo thống kê của Dự án phòng chống ung thư Quốc gia, mỗi năm ở Việt Nam có khoảng 70.000 người chết và hơn 200.000 nghìn người mắc mới. Đó là con số đáng báo động về tình hình mắc bệnh ung thư ở nước ta. Và theo dự đoán, con số này sẽ không dừng lại ở đó mà còn gia tăng trong những năm tiếp.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ăn uống thế nào để khỏe mạnh? Có lẽ đây là một câu hỏi khó giải đáp bởi vì cuộc sống ngày nay rất đa dạng về các loại thực phẩm ăn uống. Chính vì điều đó mà đã có rất nhiều người lo lắng về việc ăn uống của mình sao cho phù hợp và đảm bảo cho sức khỏe. Vì chế độ ăn uống đóng vai trò quan trọng đối với sức khỏe và hoạt động thể chất lẫn lẫn tinh thần của chúng ta. Vậy nên điều cần thiết là cần có nhận thức đúng đắn về chế độ ăn lành mạnh và khoa học. Ăn uống, đó là yếu tố cơ bản quyết định tình trạng sức khỏe, sự trường thọ và khả năng làm việc. Nó cần tương ứng với tuổi tác, giới tính, nghề nghiệp. Bạn có thể đặt ra cho gia đình mình một khẩu phần ăn lành mạnh, có thể chọn được những thực phẩm đa dạng, nếu biết thành phần và tính chất của chúng. Nhưng điều đó chưa đủ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách trình bày tóm tắt những nghiên cứu khoa học mới nhất, khẳng định rằng một số bệnh ung thư có thể được phòng tránh bằng cách thay đổi thói quen ăn uống. Thiên nhiên đã cung cấp cho con người các loại thực phẩm giàu các phân tử có tính năng chống ung thư mạnh, có khả năng kiểm soát bệnh mà không gây ra tác dụng phụ nguy hại nào. Cuốn sách không chỉ là những con số thống kê hay những về căn bệnh ung thư. Trong chúng ta, ai cũng sợ mắc bệnh ung thư, và tin rằng có rất ít khả năng ngăn ngừa căn bệnh này. Người ta quy cho sự phát triển của bệnh ung thư là do yếu tố di truyền  hoặc do số phận. Tuy nhiên, các nhà khoa học đã nghiên cứu và nhận thấy đó không phải là lý do thuyết phục, và cho rằng các yếu tố về lối sống như chế độ dinh dưỡng mới đóng vai trò chính yếu để ngăn ngừa bệnh ung thư.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Quyển sách này sẽ giúp bạn điều gì? Mục đích của quyển sách này không cổ xúy cho một chế độ dinh dưỡng cụ thể nào. Các chương trong quyển sách chứa đựng những thông tin giúp bạn hấp thu cân bằng protein (chất đạm), chất béo, carbohydrate, vitamin và khoáng chất. Tác giả mong muốn cung cấp cho bạn những thông tin hữu ích về vai trò của chế độ dinh dưỡng trong việc ngăn ngừa bệnh ung thư, và một số phương pháp dinh dưỡng truyền thống có thể làm giảm nguy cơ phát triển bệnh. Những lời khuyên trong sách dựa trên vai trò tự nhiên của rau củ quả: bổ sung hợp chất thiết yếu vào cơ thể để chống lại ung thư. Ngoài ra, các dữ liệu khoa học cũng nêu bật vai trò của trái cây và rau củ tự nhiên trong việc cung cấp các phân tử đặc biệt chống ung thư.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Điều quan trọng nhất là phải hiểu loại thức ăn nào hợp và không hợp với mình. Hãy lưu ý đến khả năng dung nạp của cơ thể đối với các loại thực phẩm để tránh tình trạng cơ thể phải “đáp trả” lại các thực phẩm và thói quen ăn uống không phù hợp của bạn.</p>', '2016-06-14', 0, NULL, 1, 7, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', NULL, 4, 110000, 138000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/chuaungthubanganuong.u335.d20160624.t111341.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Ngược lại, tôn giáo và chủ nghĩa duy vật, ngôn ngữ đa dạng, dân chúng với nhiều trình độ phát triển kinh tế, kinh nghiệm lịch sử khác nhau, trong số các yếu tố khác, đã khiến cho cuông cuộc xây dựng quốc gia của Israel đặc biệt phức tạp và đầy thử thách. Một mảnh đất nhỏ bé và khô cằn, tài nguyên thiên nhiên ít ỏi, bao quanh bởi các nước làng giềng thù địch, cùng với những câu chuyện thành công ngoạn mục đã làm cho Israel trở nên một đất nước như huyền thoại.Vậy thì chìa khóa của những thành tựu của người Do Thái nằm ở đâu nếu không phải là nằm ở nơi những cổ vật quý giá hay ở kích thước địa lý của đất nước và lịch sử? Lần theo câu hỏi này chúng ta phát hiện ra rằng cái đã nâng người Do Thái từ tăm tối lên tới vĩ đại chính là sự khao khát của họ trong việc truy cầu những ý nghĩa lớn lao của cuộc sống.Chúng ta hãy cùng nhau quay lại cuốn phim lịch sử, lần bước theo hành trình kinh ngạc của dân tộc đáng ngưỡng mộ này qua cuốn sách “Câu chuyện Do Thái: Lịch sử thăng trầm của một dân tộc”.</p>  <p>Ông Hoàng Anh Tuấn - Viện trưởng Viện nghiên cứu Chiến lược và Chính sách Ngoại giao, Học viện ngoại giao, Bộ Ngoại giao đã viết trong lời giới thiệu rằng: “Thế giới chúng ta đang sống là một thế giới đa dạng, nhiều sắc màu. Có những dân tộc bị vùi dập xuống tận bùn đen, rồi ngậm ngùi cho đó là “số phận”. Có những dân tộc luôn sẵn sàng tiến về phía trước, chấp nhận thách thức và nhờ vậy đã thành công, có những phát kiến, đóng góp vĩ đại cho nhân loại.</p>  <p>Người Do Thái và Quốc gia Do Thái Israel là một trong số rất ít các ví dụ điển hình. Trên thế giới có lẽ chưa có trường hợp nào như người Do Thái, cả một dân tộc chịu cảnh “thiên di”, sống lưu vong, phiêu bạt khăp nơi trên thế giới trên 2000 năm nhưng vẫn phục quốc thành công với nguyên bản sắc và tôn giáo của mình. Không chỉ có vậy, với tổng số 16 triệu người, tức chiếm khoảng 0,2% dân số thế giới, người Do Thái đã đứng ở đỉnh cao trong rất nhiều lĩnh vực và có đóng góp to lớn cho nhân loại, thể hiện rõ nhất qua việc họ giành được khoảng 30% tổng giải thưởng Nobel trong các lĩnh vực khoa học, kinh tế và y học từ trước đến nay.</p>  <p>Với một cuốn khảo cứu chưa đầy 300 trang dưới tiêu đề “Câu chuyện Do Thái: Lịch sử thăng trầm của một dân tộc”, tác giả Đặng Hoàng Xa, người đã dành rất nhiều thời gian và tâm sức cho đề tài này, đã vẽ nên một bức tranh lịch sử sống động trải dài qua 4000 năm đầy bi thương, nhưng cũng đầy quả cảm của dân tộc Do Thái. Với óc quan sát tinh tế, cộng với tư duy logic của người làm khoa học, tác giả Đặng Hoàng Xa đã đưa ra cách nhìn đa chiều về các yếu tố tôn giáo, văn hóa, kinh tế, chính trị, lịch sử và có những lý giải khá thuyết phục về câu chuyện thành công của người Do Thái cũng như quá trình hình thành và xây dựng đất nước của Nhà nước Israel hiện đại ngày nay.</p>  <p>Tuy câu chuyện là của người Do Thái và Nhà nước Israel, nhưng qua đây chúng ta cũng thấy có nhiều nét tương đồng về tinh thuần bất khuất, không chịu lùi bước trước gian khó của người Việt và người Do Thái. Cái còn lại là câu hỏi còn bỏ ngỏ cho bạn đọc là liệu chúng ta có thể học gì để thành công trong công cuộc phát triển và bảo vệ đất nước như người Do Thái?</p>', '2010-01-14', 0, 66, NULL, 14, 'null', 'null', NULL, 1, 62000, 78000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/cau-chuyen-do-thai.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Đây là tập hợp những triết lý mà ông đúc rút ra được từ thực tế sau bao nhiêu năm gian nan xây dựng công ty.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Trước thực tại của một xã hội Nhật Bản mà con người ngày càng đánh mất đi giá trị truyền thống, Inamori Kazuo đưa ra một yêu cầu bức thiết là phải nhìn lại “lẽ sống” của con người thời hiện đại. Lẽ sống qua cái nhìn của tác giả không phải là cái gì xa vời mà là những điều giản đơn, những giá trị gần gũi hay những thói quen hằng ngày: “những nguyên tắc đạo đức chân phương”. Cách sống gồm 5 chương, mỗi chương là một quan điểm của tác giả:</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Chương 1. Biến suy nghĩ thành hiện thực.</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chúng ta không thể có các ý tưởng và sáng tạo nếu lười suy nghĩ. Chắc các bạn biết không ít những nhà bác học như Edison hay Newton tìm ra những phát minh trong những lúc bình thường nhất, bởi họ sống với những trăn trở, không ngừng tìm kiếm lời giải đáp cho vấn đề. Cuộc đời chỉ cho ta những điều ta muốn có, vì vậy hãy suy nghĩ “Suy nghĩ phải thấu đáo, phải liên tục, không ngừng nghỉ cả ngày lẫn đêm…” hãy hình dung “sẽ thực hiện được nếu hình dung ra mọi ngõ ngách của công việc”, hãy lên kế hoạch “không thể thành công nếu không lập kế hoạch chi tiết và chuẩn bị chu đáo”</span>.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Chương 2. Suy nghĩ từ nguyên lý và nguyên tắc.</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Những nguyên lý và nguyên tắc chân phương như những chuẩn mực đạo đức mà bạn vẫn được bố mẹ dạy bảo từ khi còn nhỏ, chúng không những tốt cho cuộc sống mà còn cả trong kinh doanh. Hãy sống kiên định với những nguyên tắc đó, nó sẽ chỉ đường cho bạn ngay cả khi bạn lạc lối.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Chương 3. Mài giũa nhân cách và nâng cao tâm hồn.</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Tác giả có đưa ra một phương trình: “Cuộc đời và thành quả công việc = Tư duy x Nhiệt huyết x Năng lực”. Năng lực có thể do bẩm sinh hoặc học tập, nhiệt huyết có thể tìm thấy qua quá trình lao động nhưng có nhiệt huyết và năng lực mà đi sai hướng thì cũng không thể thành công. Cũng như một kẻ học giả trở thành mafia trí thức trong thế giới ngầm vậy. Vì vậy nhân cách và tâm hồn phải được đề cao, mài giũa qua thời gian.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Chương 4. Sống với lòng vị tha.</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Vị tha không phải là cái gì quá cao xa, đơn giản chỉ là những hành động “suy nghĩ cho người khác” cống hiến hết mình cho nhân loại, cho xã hội. Hãy bắt đầu từ việc để tâm một chút đến những người thân thiết xung quanh ta.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Chương 5. Hòa hợp với dòng chảy vũ trụ.</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Có hai bàn tay vô hình chi phối cuộc đời con người. Đó là “số mệnh” và “luật nhân quả báo ứng”. Mỗi ngươi tuy có mệnh sẵn nhưng nếu biết vận dụng luật nhân quả có thể thay đổi vận mệnh cho mình bằng cách nghĩ điều thiện, làm việc thiện.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Ở mỗi chương, mỗi quan điểm của mình tác giả đều đưa ra những dẫn chứng, những câu chuyện thực tế rất thuyết phục. Vốn đi lên từ những thất bại, con đường thành công của tác giả vô cùng khó khăn. Những điều ông viết trong “Cách Sống” là những kinh nghiệm quý giá mà ông muốn chia sẻ với giới trẻ. Đây quả thực là một cuốn sách thiết thực, hãy đọc, suy ngẫm và thay đổi.</span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>***</strong><br /><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Trích đoạn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a>:</span></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: small;">Chúng ta đang sống trong một thời đại lo âu, đầy biến cố, tương lai bất định.

Hơn thế nữa, nhiều người còn muốn tự "đúc" cho mình dòng gà thật hay, thật xuất sắc với những đòn độc, thế hiểm để nuôi mãi suốt đời, và truyền giống lại cho con cháu đời sau. Đó là ý muốn tạo được mái gốc, mái tuyển cho riêng mình. Tự tạo một mái gốc vừa ý, việc này tất nhiên quá khó, đòi hỏi sự đam mê cao độ và sự quyết tâm thực hiện của mình, may ra mới được. Ngoại trừ có một cơ may nào thì không nói. Vì rằng, nếu việc thực hiện dễ, thì giới nuôi gà xưa nay, ai ai cũng có dòng mái riêng để nuôi thoả thích rồi! Đã nuôi gà nòi thì ai cũng đam mê cao độ. Nuôi một vài con mấy ai đã cho là đủ? Vì vậy, ngày xưa, những sự kê có điều kiện chăn nuôi, trong nhà úp hàng trăm bội gà là chuyện thường thấy. Mỗi dịp đem gà đi đá ở tỉnh xa, họ chở gà trên vài ba chiếc ghe to, trên đó úp cơ man nào là bội…</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ngày nay, ít ai có điều kiện như vậy, và chúng tôi cũng không dám khuyến khích các bạn nuôi với số lượng quá nhiều. Thiết nghĩ, mỗi chúng ta, ham lắm, trong nhà nuôi độ vài ba con đã là quá đủ. Thà nuôi số lượng ít nhưng, tất cả đều gà dữ gà hay cũng đủ cho ta toại ý rồi. Và, như vậy cũng đủ nổi tiếng rồi! Sự khó khăn, vất vả, đó cũng là cái thú nuôi gà nòi tự mình chọn được cho mình những con gà xuất sắc trong thế đá, đòn đa, và có những vảy tốt, vảy quí hiếm mà nuôi. Những con chiến kê “đáng đồng tiền” đó chắc chắn ai cũng phải quí, phải ham. Muốn vậy, các bạn phải nắm được bí quyết chọn gà cách xem hình tướng, cách chọn vảy ra sao… Chọn được gà tốt là một điều mừng, nhưng còn phải nắm vững cách nuôi dưỡng và chăm sóc gà trong từng giai đoạn ra sao nữa thì nỗi lo và sự vất vả mới… không còn để nặng trong ta nữa.</p>', '2016-02-14', 0, 390, 27, 24, 'NXB Thanh Hóa', 'null', 168, 7, 36000, 45000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/img010_5_5.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Nhưng, bây giờ kiến thức nằm hết trên mạng, trong file máy tính, truy cập là ra ngay, nên các nước đã phải thay đổi chương trình học phổ thông sau khi máy tính và internet ra đời. Học sinh chỉ cần nhớ những gì cốt lõi, và PHƯƠNG PHÁP tìm kiếm tài liệu.

Khi con người biết được tầm quan trọng và cần thiết của sức khỏe thì cuộc sống lành mạnh và bữa ăn dinh dưỡng khoa học sẽ ngày càng được coi trọng.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Con người đã sớm hiểu được mối quan hệ mất thiết giữa các bữa ăn và sức khỏe. Nhà toán học Hy Lạp cổ Pythagoras đã từng nói rằng: “Không nên coi nhẹ sức khỏe của bạn, giống như việc ăn uống cần có sự cân bằng, hạn chế”. Do sự tiến bộ của y học hiện đại và y tế công cộng, tuổi thọ của con người đã được kéo dài hơn, quan điểm về ăn uống đúng đắn có tầm quan trọng rõ rệt đối với sức khỏe con người hiện đại. Ngày nay các cơ quan chính phủ đến các chuyên gia đều rất coi trọng tuyên truyền và mở rộng văn hóa ẩm thực lành mạnh đến mọi nhà. Từ xưa đến nay, dân nước ta đều rất coi trọng ăn uống, những món nên ăn và không nên ăn có quan hệ mật thiết đến sức khỏe của con người. Xã hội và khoa học kỹ thuật không ngừng phát triển, đời sống của người dân được nâng cao, vì thế mọi người càng quan tâm hơn xem nên ăn gì và không nên ăn gì, người không cùng thể chất, không c&ugraugrave;ng dân tộc nên ăn những món ăn gì để bảo đảm sức khỏe nhất.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tập sách chính là cuốn từ điển bách khoa ăn uống nêu ra những món nên ăn và không nên ăn phù hợp với nhu cầu cuộc sống sức khỏe của người hiện đại. Toàn bộ tập sách chia làm 8 tập “Những món ăn nên và không nên dành cho trẻ”, “Những món ăn nên và không nên dành cho trẻ đang tuổi phát triển”, “Những món ăn nướng”, “Những món ăn dành cho thời kỳ kinh nguyệt”, “Những món ăn nên và không nên dành cho bà bầu”, “Những món ăn nên và không nên dành cho sản phụ”, “Những món ăn nên và không nên giúp bạn gái làm đẹp”, “Những món ăn nên và không nên dành cho người mắc bệnh thường gặp”.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách “Những món ăn nên và không nên dành cho bà bầu” chủ yếu giới thiệu tầm quan trọng dinh dưỡng trước khi sinh đẻ và các nguyên tắc ăn uống, các kiến thức ăn uống trong giai đoạn mang thai, thói quen ăn uống không tốt của thai phụ, những thay đổi sinh lí ở các giai đoạn khác nhau của thai nhi và thai phụ, cuốn sách giới thiệu các món ăn nên và không nên thường gặp trọng điểm thời kỳ đầu mang thai (từ 1-3 tháng), thời kỳ giữa mang thai (từ 4-6 tháng), thời kỳ cuối mang thai (từ 7 tháng đến khi đẻ).</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Cuốn sách biên tập theo cơ sở y học truyền thống và dưỡng sinh, tham khảo các tài liệu về món ăn kiêng kị hoặc nên ăn, kết hợp với thành quả nghiên cứu của y học hiện đại và dinh dưỡng học, nhằm vào nhu cầu ăn uống của các lứa tuổi, thể chất, nhóm người khác nhau, trọng điểm giới thiệu những kiến thức ăn uống dành cho trẻ nhỏ, thiếu niên, người già, phụ nữ thời kỳ kinh nguyệt, thai phụ, sản phụ, phụ nữ muốn làm đẹp và những người mắc bệnh thường gặp. Cuốn sách do các chuyên gia dinh dưỡng, bác sĩ và các đầu bếp hợp tác biên tập, nội dung khoa học thực tế, dễ hiểu, giúp các bạn đọc biết ăn gì và ăn như thế nào.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đây là cuốn từ điển ẩm thực trí tuệ với các món ăn nên và không nên, là lựa chọn sáng suốt dành cho các gia đình. Vì khi chúng ta biết ăn gì, ăn như thế nào, sẽ giúp cơ thể khỏe mạnh, phòng tránh bệnh tật, đó cũng là nguyện vọng chung của những người làm công tác biên tập như chúng tôi.<span style="font-size: medium; color: #ff6600;"><strong><br /></strong></span></p>', '2012-09-14', 0, 210, 15, 25, 'NXB Văn Hoá Thông Tin', 'null', 168, 5, 54400, 68000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/cam-nang-dinh-duong-cho-phu-nu-mang-thai.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Đây là một quá trình đòi hỏi sự hiểu biết tổng hợp về các lĩnh vực y học, sinh học, tâm lý, văn hoá,… chứ không hẳn chỉ dựa vào bản năng tự nhiên. Ngày nay, do sự phát triển của xã hội nên đối với nhiều phụ nữ, việc làm mẹ diễn ra muộn hơn so với trước kia.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đa số phụ nữ vẫn làm việc trong phần lớn thời gian mang thai. Điều này đồng nghĩa với việc lập kế hoạch cho quá trình mang thai và sinh nở ngày nay trở nên khác hẳn so với quá khứ, khi nhiều phụ nữ nghỉ việc ở nhà khi mang thai.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hiện nay, đa số phụ nữ đều cảm thấy phải cân nhắc thận trọng công việc tương lai của mình, và trong cuốn “<strong>Cẩm nang dành cho người mẹ sinh con đầu lòng</strong>” này, các tác giả đã phác thảo những ưu điểm và khuyết điểm trong việc kết hợp công việc, mang thai và làm vợ, làm mẹ.

Đối với các bậc cha mẹ, sách này đóng vai trò như một người bạn đồng hành trong suốt thời gian dài - từ lúc bé mới sinh ra cho đến tuổi niên thiếu.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tác giả chắc chắn không muốn các bạn dùng nó làm “sách gối đầu giường đâu”, vì lẽ đơn giản gối đầu nhiều thì sẽ ít mở sách ra! Trái lại cuốn sách này nhằm được mở ra tra cứu ứng xử khi đứng trước bất cứ chứng bệnh nào có thể sẽ gặp trong quá trình nuôi con. Vì thế các loại bệnh trong cuốn sách này đã được lựa chọn và sắp xếp theo thứ tự từ A đến Z của bảng chữ cái để bạn đọc dễ tìm kiếm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Nét đặc biệt thứ hai của cuốn sách này là nó có nhiều hình để minh hoạ, khởi đầu từ hình mặt trước và sau toàn bộ cơ thể một em bé, với những mũi tên chỉ vào từng vùng hay phân đoạn - kiểu như khi bác sĩ khám bệnh, hỏi bệnh nhân của mình đau ở đâu thì em bé sẽ chỉ ngay vào đó, để tránh mọi sự nhầm lẫn do phiến diện! Khi đi sâu vào từng bệnh cũng vậy, có hình lớn hơn của cơ quan hay bộ phận liên quan.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đặc điểm thứ ba, là mỗi tình huống bệnh lý luôn luôn được giới thiệu theo một trình tự có hệ thống, nhằm giải đáp mọi thắc mắc, hướng dẫn từng bước cách ứng xử hợp lý nhất để giải quyết vấn đề tại nhà, trong khi chờ đợi bác sĩ - nếu xét thấy cần đi khám bác sĩ. Nhìn qua các đề mục lập lại cho mỗi bệnh, cũng hiểu rõ mục tiêu này và giúp người săn sóc bé tìm ngay tới điều mình cần đọc: Tên bệnh nghiêm trọng không? Triệu chứng có thể gặp? Việc gì cần làm trước tiên? Có cần đưa đi bác sĩ không? Bác sĩ sẽ có thể làm gì? Tôi có thể làm gì để giúp bé? Và cuối cùng có một khung nhỏ, gợi ý “xem thêm một số chứng bệnh ở mục khác đôi khi có cùng triệu chứng.

Không phụ thuộc vào công ty du lịch, bạn có thể bất thần dừng chân giữa đường nếu muốn. Để ngả lưng một chút, hay để lưu lại những khoảnh khắc đẹp miên man trên đường. Đi du lịch bụi cho bạn cảm giác tự do mãnh liệt, những cảm nhận thật và gần gũi hơn với đất và người. Bạn được hoà mình trọn vẹn vào cảnh quan xung quanh, để cho mùi mưa, nắng, gió ngấm cả vào hồn. Đó là chất men của loại hình du lịch này vậy.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Khác với du lịch theo tour, khi đi “phượt”, bạn phải tự mình tìm hiểu tuyến đường, lên lịch trình cho phù hợp, tự tìm thông tin về những địa điểm đáng lưu tâm và tự chuẩn bị nơi ăn chốn ở,… Vì bạn sẽ đi bằng phương tiện của mình, nên việc chuẩn bị lại càng phải chu đáo. Đi phượt không bao giờ dễ dàng, bạn sẽ phải đối mặt với đủ loại tình huống: đường quá xấu, xe hỏng, xăm thủng, lạc đường, kiệt sức,… Đây là những điều khó và cũng chính là một nét hấp dẫn khó cưỡng lại nổi với những kẻ trót say cảm giác phiêu lưu. Nó thử thách những giới hạn của bạn, nó làm bộc lộ trong bạn những con người mà trong hoàn cảnh bình thường bạn chẳng bao giờ biết đến.

Đến nay, tổng sản phẩm quốc dân của Trung Quốc đã đứng thứ hai trên thế giới, dự trữ ngoại tệ đứng hàng đầu thế giới. Trung Quốc đã có một vị thế mới trên trường quốc tế. Chính sách và chiến lược ngoại giao của Trung Quốc có những ảnh hưởng nhất định đối với khu vực và thế giới. Vì vậy các nước trong khu vực và trên thế giới không chỉ quan tâm, theo dõi đến những thành tựu phát triển của Trung Quốc, mà còn quan tâm nghiên cứu, tham khảo chiến lược và chính sách ngoại giao của Trung Quốc.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tuy nhiên, quan hệ quốc tế châu Á - Thái Bình Dương hiện tại đang rất “nóng” với quá trình dịch chuyển quyền lực giữa một bên là Trung Quốc - cường quốc đang trỗi dậy, còn bên kia là Mỹ - cường quốc truyền thống. Và Việt Nam - với tư cách một quốc gia có vị trí chiến lược và vai trò quốc tế đang nổi lên rất nhanh cần phải xử lý thực sự khôn khéo trong môi trường chính trị khu vực đầy biến động như thế.

Giống như ươm một mầm cây từ trong lòng đất, chỉ cần mảnh đất đó màu mỡ, đầy đủ ánh sáng và nước, mầm cây sẽ “lớn nhanh như thổi”. Người mẹ chính là “mảnh đất”, chăm sóc người mẹ chu đáo là mang lại “ánh sáng” và “nguồn nước” tốt nhất  để thai nhi phát triển! Làm thế nào để chăm sóc bà mẹ và thai nhi tốt là chủ đề chính của cuốn sách này.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Làm việc ở khoa sản gần 40 năm, tôi đã tiếp xúc với nhiều thai phụ, sản phụ, trong đó không ít thai phụ khi mang bầu vô cùng cẩn trọng, ăn uống rất cầu kỳ, thực ra điều này không cần thiết. Mặc dù thai nhi non nớt, nhưng không yếu ớt,  mà có một sinh lực dẻo dai. Mang bầu là một quá trình tự nhiên, điều cần thiết đối với thai phụ là chăm sóc tốt bản thân, có chế độ ăn uống, ngủ nghỉ  hợp lý, tinh thần thoải mái, không buồn phiền lo lắng. Ngoài ra, các thai phụ còn có thể nói chuyện với thai nhi, để sau khi sinh ra bé sẽ thông minh, đáng yêu hơn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Quá trình mang thai khoảng 40 tuần sẽ trôi qua nhanh chóng. Sau 40 tuần đó, chúng ta sẽ cùng em bé bắt đầu một cuộc sống mới. Trở th&agragrave;nh cha mẹ, chắc chắn bạn sẽ cảm thấy cuộc sống có một ý nghĩa đặc biệt hơn.Gia đình bạn bắt đầu có một em bé vô cùng đáng yêu, bạn cũng bắt đầu mỉm cười vô thức và luôn dành những điều tốt đẹp nhất cho con mình, mong con mau lớn, khỏe mạnh, vui tươi. Có điều, chăm sóc con cái không phải là việc đơn giản. Khi còn nhỏ nằm trong vòng tay của bố mẹ, con chỉ cần bạn chăm lo cho bữa ăn giấc ngủ. Khi con dần lớn lên, bạn còn cần quan tâm đến những buồn vui, hờn giận, trạnh thái sinh lý của bé... Chẳng hạn: lựa chọn quần áo cho con thế nào khi thời tiết chuyển mùa, dỗ dành con làm sao khi bé hờn dỗi, chăm sóc như thế nào khi con sốt, bệnh?... Những điều này đều cần bậc cha mẹ phải từng bước học hỏi. Cuốn sách không chỉ giải quyết tất cả những vấn đề bạn gặp phải, mà còn là kim chỉ nam trong việc chăm sóc con cái của bạn. Hi vọng cuốn sách giúp bạn thoải mái và yên tâm hơn trong suốt chặng đường dài: mang bầu, sinh nở và giáo dục con cái.

Đây là phương pháp giáo dục sớm đến từ Nhật Bản dựa trên sự phát triển não bộ của trẻ từ 0 đến 6 tuổi. <strong>Phương pháp Shichida</strong> đã được phát triển dựa trên nền tảng khoa học và chứng thực về não phải, cân bằng phát triển hai bán cầu não. Từ đó, khả năng của trẻ không chỉ dừng lại ở các kỹ năng cơ bản như đọc, toán, nhạc, họa… mà qua đó phát triển hình thành tính cách, năng lực tư duy, <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> và sự gắn kết giữa cha mẹ và con cái.<br /><br /><strong>Chìa khóa vàng thứ nhất: Yêu Thương</strong><br /><br />Cách tốt nhất để cha mẹ thành công trong quá trình nuôi dạy con là tận hưởng quá trình này, giữ cho cả mình và con cùng vui vẻ. Nếu tâm lý cha mẹ không thoải mái thì việc nuôi con sẽ khó diễn ra suôn sẻ.<br /><br />Khi việc nuôi dạy con càng ngày càng trở nên quá khó khăn, hãy xem lại bản thân mình. Bởi con cái là hình ảnh phản chiếu của cha mẹ. Tình trạng hiện tại của con đều là kết quả của quá trình giáo dục. Vì vậy, hãy quyết định thay đổi phương pháp một cách triệt để.<br /><br />Suy cho cùng, mục đích cho việc nuôi dạy con là nuôi dưỡng trái tim con trẻ. Bên cạnh đó, tình yêu thương giúp tạo nguồn động lực cho con. Nguồn động lực ở con trẻ trỗi dậy nhờ vào cảm giác an toàn mà con cảm nhận được từ tình thương của mẹ. Từ đó, tình yêu thương của cha mẹ sẽ nuôi dưỡng tâm hồn trẻ, giúp trẻ trở thành một con người phát triển toàn diện và hạnh phúc sau này.<br /><br /><strong>Chìa khóa vàng thứ hai: Khen Ngợi</strong><br /><br />Khen ngợi trẻ giúp xây dựng lòng tự tin của trẻ. Thay vì chăm chăm vào khuyết điểm con cái và không khen ngợi chúng, thì hãy nhìn nhận những gì con đang có và cố gắng ngợi khen. Nếu không chú ý đến những khuyết điểm mà chỉ tập trung vào ưu điểm và khen ngợi con thì những ưu điểm sẽ ngày càng lớn mạnh, còn khuyết điểm sẽ từ từ biến mất.<br /><br />Hãy tin tưởng con trước khi nghĩ đến việc kỷ luật con.<br /><br /><strong>Chìa khóa vàng thứ hai: Nhìn Nhận</strong><br /><br />Nhìn nhận con có nghĩa là bố mẹ tin tưởng ở con. Thông thường, các bậc phụ huynh luôn muốn nuôi dạy con thật tốt. Nhưng một trong những điểm quan trọng trong việc nuôi dạy con mà bố mẹ hay bỏ sót là cần nhìn nhận con đúng với những gì con đang có. Vấn đề không nằm ở chỗ con có thể hay không thể làm một việc gì. Hiểu được điều này, bố mẹ sẽ có được những niềm vui, hạnh phúc trong quá trình nuôi dạy con nhiều hơn là những mệt mỏi vất vả.</p>', '2015-12-14', 0, NULL, 1, 17, 'NXB Thế Giới', 'null', NULL, 5, 50000, 62000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/3chiakhoavangshichida_.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Điều đó cũng là tính cách của nhân vật chính, Holden - nổi loạn, thiếu giáo dục, và lạ lùng. </span></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #003366;">Holden không thích cái gì cả, cậu chỉ muốn đứng trên mép vực của một cánh đồng bao la, để trông chừng lũ trẻ con đang chơi đùa.

Nhưng tôi không muốn đi vào những chuyện ấy, nói thật với bạn. Trước hết là vì những thứ đó đối với tôi không có gì là quyến rũ, sau nữa là vì cha mẹ tôi sẽ thổ huyết chừng hai chuyến nếu tôi kể ra điều gì hơi rõ ràng về họ. Họ rất nhạy cảm về những loại như thế, nhất là cha tôi. Họ cũng tử tế đấy chứ - tôi không biết dùng tiếng gì - nhưng đồng thời cũng nhạy cảm khiếp. Ngoài ra tôi cũng không kể cho bạn nghe cái tiểu sử dở hơi của tôi hay gì hết. Tôi chỉ kể cho bạn cái chuyện điên khùng đã xảy đến với tôi vào khoảng cuối lễ Giáng sinh năm ngoái ngay trước khi tôi thành ra lụn bại tinh thần và phải ra đây xã hơi một chút. Nghĩa là cái chuyện mà tôi đã kể hết cho D.B nghe. D.B là anh tôi. Ảnh bây giờ ở Hollywood. Chỗ đó không xa cái nơi hạ tiện này bao nhiêu, và ảnh thường đến tham tôi mỗi cuối tuần, gần như đều đều vậy. Ảnh có lẽ sẽ lái xe chở tôi về nhà khi tôi về vào cuối tháng này. Ảnh vừa mới tậu một chiếc Jaguar. Cái loại xe kiểu Anh chạy chừng hai trăm rưỡi cây số giờ ấy. Ảnh phải trả có đến gần bốn ngàn đồng là ít. Hiện giờ ảnh có khá nhiều xu. Trước kia thì ảnh không có. Hồi trước, lúc ở nhà, ảnh là một văn sĩ suốt ngày chỉ viết lách. Ảnh có viết tập truyện ngắn cực đỉnh nhan đề là Con cá vàng bí mật (trong trường hợp bạn chưa hề nghe đến tên ảnh) . Câu chuyện hay nhất trong ấy là chuyện "Con cá vàng bí mật". Chuyện kể về chú bé con không chịu cho ai nhìn con cá thia vàng của chú bởi vì chú đã tự bỏ tiền ra mua nó. Tôi mê câu chuyện ấy đến chết được. Bây giờ thì ảnh ở Hollywood, anh chàng D.B ấy, đang đánh đĩ ngòi bút. Nếu có một cái gì tôi chúa ghét, thì ấy chính là màn bạc.

Tuy nhiên, điều gì quyết định năng lực của trẻ? Do di truyền hay là do kết quả của quá trình giáo dục? Điều này đã gây ra nhiều cuộc tranh cãi về thiên hướng tự nhiên hay điều kiện nuôi dưỡng - giáo dục quyết định đến năng lực cũng như trí thông minh của trẻ. Và đáng tiếc là trong phần lớn thời gian ấy, cuộc tranh luận chỉ tập trung vào vấn đề: hoặc cái này, hoặc cái kia. Giờ đây, câu trả lời đã được rõ ràng hơn rằng cả hai yếu tố trên đều giữ vai trò nhất định. Việc của ba mẹ và những người nuôi dưỡng trẻ bên cạnh việc nuôi trẻ lớn, khỏe với những dưỡng chất cần thiết thì quan trọng hơn là tạo cho trẻ một môi trường và giáo dục để trẻ có thể phát huy những tiềm năng sẵn có.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bộ não tí hon</strong> là bộ sách giúp ba mẹ có hiểu hơn về trí não của trẻ để từ đó tạo cho bộ não của con bạn có một môi trường thuận lợi để phát triển, cũng từ đó, bé sẽ phát huy được những tiềm năng sẵn có của mình. Bộ não tí hon bao gồm 2 tập, <strong>Tập 1: Cái nôi của thiên tài</strong>, với những kiến thức căn bản về bộ não trẻ. T<strong>ập 2: Thay đổi thế giới</strong>, đi sâu hơn với nhiều thông tin và kiến thức bổ ích của bố mẹ để có thế giúp trẻ phát triển một cách toàn diện.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bộ não tí hon tập 2: Thay đổi thế giới</strong> bao gồm 3 phần:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phần 1: Môi trường lý tưởng cho bộ não phát triển. Việc tạo cho bé một môi trường phát triển là một việc vô cùng quan trọng. Môi trường phát triển cho bé không chỉ là môi trường học hành mà còn có cả môi trường vui chơi. Trẻ sẽ biết ơn cha mẹ rất nhiều khi cho trẻ một tuổi thơ vui vẻ, một thiên đàng tuổi thơ và việc chơi sẽ có ích rất nhiều cho bộ não trẻ phát triển.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phần 2: Các giác quan. Ngay từ bé, trẻ đã biết dùng các giác quan để khám phá thế giới. Tìm hiểu thêm về các giác quan của trẻ để có thể khuyến khích và tạo điều kiện trẻ sử dụng và phát huy mọi giác quan của cơ thể mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Phần 3: Học hỏi.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với 16 chương và nhiều câu chuyện nhỏ sẽ giúp ích rất nhiều cho các bậc phụ huynh trong việc giáo dục và chơi cùng con. Những câu chuyện nhỏ nhưng sẽ giúp phụ huynh hiểu rõ hơn về thực chất khả năng của trẻ. Đôi khi, chỉ vì ba mẹ ấn định khả năng của trẻ mà không tạo điều kiện để trẻ có thể phát huy hết khả năng của mình.Bộ não tí hon là bộ sách hữu ích cho các bậc cha mẹ quan tâm đến việc phát triển khả năng của trẻ. Giáo dục không có nghĩa là bắt trẻ phát triển theo một khuôn mẫu mà là phát triển theo đúng khả năng và con người của trẻ. Để từ đó, trẻ không chỉ hoàn thiện hơn mà còn là những con người hạnh phúc.</p>', '2010-01-14', 0, 401, NULL, 3, 'null', 'null', NULL, 12, 69000, 86000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/bo-nao-ti-hon-tap-2.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Lần này, First News tiếp tục gửi tới các em cuốn sách còn lại trong bộ sách nổi tiếng từng được bình chọn là một trong 10 cuốn sách hướng dẫn tốt nhất trên tờ The Independent - Tăng cường trí nhớ và khả năng tập trung. Một trong những bí quyết giúp việc học của các em đạt kết quả cao chính là khả năng ghi nhớ và tập trung. Nhưng làm như thế nào để có thể phát huy khả năng này ở mỗi người? Các em sẽ có câu trả lời thỏa đáng trong cuốn sách lần này của tác giả Tony Buzan. Tăng cường trí nhớ và khả năng tập trung sẽ giúp các em:</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Ghi nhớ lâu mọi điều- Dễ dàng tiếp thu các thông tin, số liệu và công thức</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Tăng cường khả năng tập trung và niềm yêu thích học tập</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Nhớ được tên, các sự kiện và lời thoại cho một vai diễn</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Không cần áp lực mà vẫn nhớ lại được những gì tưởng đã quên</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">- Cắt ngắn thời gian học xuống còn một nửa, trong khi kết quả học tập lại tốt hơn đáng kể</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Theo Tony Buzan, khả năng ghi nhớ của các em là vô cùng tận. Tuy nhiên, cũng có lúc do đang ở đợt cao điểm và đang chịu áp lực phải ghi nhớ quá nhiều thứ khiến các em rơi vào trạng trái đầu óc “trống rỗng”. Sẽ thật nguy hiểm khi các em bị “tắc tị” những lúc bị hỏi bài trong lớp hay trong các kỳ thi. Càng nguy hiểm hơn khi các em càng cố “vắt óc” để nhớ thì mọi thứ càng “rối tung rối mù” và tuyệt nhiên mình chẳng nhớ được bất cứ một điều gì nữa!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Các em hãy yên tâm là những gì các em đã đưa vào đầu thì sẽ luôn còn mãi. Vấn đề các em cần làm là giúp bộ não sắp xếp lại thông tin cho gọn gàng để dễ dàng truy cập khi cần sử dụng đến. Tăng cường trí nhớ và khả năng tập trung sẽ giúp các em trở thành chủ nhân thực sự đối với chính trí nhớ của mình và có thể nhớ mọi điều mà mình muốn trong bất cứ tình huống nào.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với cuốn sách lần này, Tony Buzan đã chỉ ra cho các em “chìa khóa” để có thể nhớ tốt, đó chính là hai “ngôi sao”: Trí tưởng tượng và Sự liên tưởng. Các em chỉ cần liên tưởng - dĩ nhiên là cũng sử dụng cả trí tưởng tượng nữa - điều cần nhớ với điều gì đó em đã biết. Bằng trí tưởng tượng của mình, các em sẽ làm cho những điều cần ghi nhớ trở nên thú vị hơn. Và điều gì càng thú vị thì lại càng dễ nhớ. Bên cạnh đó, liên tưởng là liên kết những gì các em đã biết lại với nhau. Nhờ đặc tính vui nhộn và đơn giản, hoạt động liên tưởng giúp các em làm phong phú thêm trí tưởng tượng của mình. Để trí tưởng tượng và sự liên tưởng của mình “làm việc” có hiệu quả, các em cần tới công cụ hỗ trợ là Bản đồ Tư duy. Cũng giống như trước đây, các em hãy chuẩn bị một tờ giấy trắng không đường kẻ - vì giấy có đường kẻ sẽ cản trở khả năng tưởng tượng, cùng một vài cây bút lông có những màu em yêu thích.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Đầu tiên, các em hãy vẽ chủ đề chính ngay giữa tờ giấy trắng. Từ một ý tưởng chính (cấp 1), các em dùng trí não của mình để đưa ra những ý tưởng chi tiết (cấp 2), rồi triển khai thêm nhiều ý tưởng chi tiết hơn (cấp 3). Các em cũng có thể dùng bút màu và bằng trí tưởng tượng của mình để vẽ những hình ảnh đơn giản minh hoa cho chủ đề. Khi đó, tất cả các thông tin em cần nhớ đã nằm gọn trong một tấm bản đồ!</p>', '2013-12-14', 0, 401, 1, 29, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', 117, 16, 54000, 82000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/ban-do-tu-duy-cho-tre-thong-minh.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Không bồng bột, không mãnh liệt, anh Chánh Văn đã thể hiện sự trưởng thành, lãng mạn của một người đàn ông 30 khi nói về giá trị của hôn nhân và gia đình. Kết quả của <a href="http://tiki.vn/tieu-thuyet-tinh-cam-lang-man/c844">tình yêu</a> là một đám cưới. Thế nhưng lại có sự khác biệt rất lớn khi hai người là người yêu của nhau và khi họ đã về chung sống dưới một mái nhà. Dường như họ đều thấy đối phương thay đổi bởi gia đình là nơi tình yêu thực tế, không chỉ là những cử chỉ quan tâm hay sự lãng mạn mà còn là các mối quan hệ với người thân, họ hàng, là trách nhiệm, tình yêu, sự chăm sóc đối với con cái. Cảm giác hụt hẫng và mất tự do thường xuất hiện sau khi kết hôn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Tác giả cũng chia sẻ trải nghiệm và suy nghĩ của mình về những giá trị của cuộc sống. Từ cách sống: "Sống để kể lại”, "bạn hãy sống bằng tất cả những gì bạn có được, nhận được, cảm được và thấy được. Bạn hãy sống thêm cả với những điều bạn muốn được, bạn mong được, bạn thích được” để mỗi ngày qua đi đều là một ngày đáng ghi nhớ, đáng kể lại. Rồi đến những chiêm nghiệm về cuộc sống của người phụ nữ: họ được thiên phú cho sắc đẹp, cho sự dịu dàng và quyến rũ nhưng chính những điều đó lại đem lại cho họ nỗi bất hạnh bạo hành, tệ buôn người hay làm vật mua vui cho đàn ông…<br /><br />Bên cạnh đó bạn đọc sẽ cảm nhận được rõ nhất  Hoàng Anh Tú – một người chồng, người cha thực thụ. Tác giả đã thể hiện tình yêu dành cho vợ con, những cảm xúc chân thực qua chính cuộc sống gia đình, tình yêu của mình. Không còn là một anh chàng "phù phiếm” của 7 năm về trước mà là một người đàn ông đầy trách nhiệm: "Sự phù phiếm đã bị giới hạn bởi trách nhiệm."<br /><br />Anh sẽ cưới em thêm nhiều lần nữa không những là một tác phẩm thú vị với những trải nghiệm mới về một Hoàng Anh Tú khác mà còn là món quà ý nghĩa nhất dành tặng cho người vợ của bạn trong ngày 8.3.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">***</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trích đoạn <a href="http://tiki.vn/sach-hay-tiki-khuyen-doc">sách hay</a></strong></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bạn thân mến!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Có lẽ bạn đã không có ý thức một cách đầy đủ và hoàn chỉnh về GIA ĐÌNH. Đó là nơi mà sự tha thứ có thể lặp lại cả triệu lần cho cùng một lỗi sai phạm. Đó là nơi mà cái đẹp của người vợ, người chồng không nằm trong cách cư xử hay hình thể. Nó nằm trong sự tự tin của mỗi người khi đứng trước cuộc đời. Tức là một người vợ đẹp là người khiến chồng mình tự tin, tự hào mỗi khi kể với mọi người về vợ họ. Và ngược lại, người chồng giỏi là khi vợ anh ta không than phiền với bạn bè hoặc than phiền với bạn bè một cách ngây thơ và trách yêu về những lỗi của chồng.<br /><br />Đó là nơi mà người ta sống đời ở kiếp với nhau chứ không phải là so đo xem sống với người này có ổn không? Tức là họ dù đang giận điên lên với chồng (hoặc vợ) nhưng cũng sẽ xù lông nhím nếu ai có ý xấu với vợ hoặc chồng mình.<br /><br />Đó là nơi tình yêu thực tế. Người ta yêu nhau không chỉ vì những cử chỉ lãng mạn hay sự quan tâm, thấu hiểu. Không chỉ  vì thế mà còn và chắc chắn là vì con cái của họ có một ông bố tốt, một bà mẹ tốt. Tức là không một mảy may nghi ngờ chồng mình là lựa chọn duy nhất và số 1 cho vị trí cha của con mình. Và ngược lại. Tức là cảm thấy yêu vợ mình hơn qua cách vợ mình chăm sóc và yêu con của mình. Và ngược lại.<br /><br />Đó là nơi bạn muốn trở về mỗi ngày khi bạn đã mỏi gối chùn chân. Không phải là để có ai đó xoa bóp cho bạn (nếu có thì quá tốt) mà là vì đó là nơi bạn an toàn nhất.<br /><br />Đó là nơi bạn muốn đi tiếp con đường xa hút phía trước mà không phải đắn đo về khả năng bạn mất nó.<br /><br />Bạn có thể yêu gia đình mình theo cách của bạn song chắc chắn, bạn sẽ chỉ là kẻ nói láo nếu như bạn bảo bạn đã làm đủ trách nhiệm của bạn với gia đình. Bạn thân mến ạ, với gia đình không bao giờ là đã làm đủ trách nhiệm. Và nếu ai đó đòi hỏi bạn phải có trách nhiệm với gia đình thì chứng tỏ bạn đã không có gia đình từ lâu lắm rồi hoặc người đó cũng chẳng biết thế nào là gia đình, anh ta chỉ nghĩ gia đình tức là 1 cái nhà có vợ anh ta ngồi chồm hỗm ở đó.</p>', '2016-09-14', 0, NULL, 8, 31, 'NXB Thanh Niên', 'null', 340, 6, 71200, 89000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/hop-3d-small.u547.d20160907.t104828.571421.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Điều quan trọng của giai đoạn này không chỉ là cho trẻ ăn và theo dõi đảm bảo sự phát triển của trẻ mà còn phải theo dõi chức năng ăn và lôi kéo hợp lý sự ham thích ăn của trẻ, làm cho trẻ tự lập. Để làm được những việc đó, thống nhất quan điểm là rất quan trọng, phải thống nhất về việc lựa chọn thực phẩm, lượng ăn, cách ăn, những người lớn xung quanh giúp đỡ như thế nào. Tuy nhiên việc ăn dặm là việc hàng ngày. Bạn có đang băn khoăn trăn trở nên cho trẻ ăn gì, ăn bao nhiêu, ăn như thế nào không. Trong giai đoạn lần đầu tiên bé tiếp xúc với thức ăn, nếu mọi người xung quanh bé quá nhạy cảm, lo lắng về bữa ăn dặm của trẻ, lo lắng đó sẽ truyền sang bé và thường làm mất đi không khí của bữa ăn vốn dĩ là vui vẻ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Chính vì thế, đúng như tiêu đề của cuốn sách, tôi giới thiệu những công thức nấu ăn đơn giản mà ai cũng có thể làm được trong thời gian ngắn bởi nó “đơn giản”, “dễ làm” và những công thức nấu ăn phong phú sáng tạo ví dụ như chia từ thức ăn của người lớn, thực đơn sử dụng baby food … Ngoài ra còn nói rất cẩn thận về những thực phẩm cần phải cân nhắc khi trẻ bị ốm, dị ứng thực phẩm. Hơn nữa, cuốn sách cũng có cả những công thức nấu ăn khi bị dị ứng để bữa ăn dặm không trở nên nhàm chán.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ngoài ra, chắc hẳn theo từng lứa tuổi, các bạn cũng nhiều điều nghi hoặc như “con tôi tỏ ra thích không thích nhiều thứ, liệu có vấn đề gì không”, “nên cân bằng sữa mẹ và ăn dặm như thế nào”??? Cuốn sách này cũng đã chuẩn bị những câu trả lời dễ hiểu cho những câu hỏi như vậy ở phần Q&amp;A. Nếu đọc phần đó bạn sẽ dễ dàng hiểu được từ bây giờ nên làm cái gì, như thế nào và bạn có thể đối diện với trẻ bằng sự rộng lượng bao dung của mình.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Hãy tiếp xúc với trẻ bằng tấm lòng bao dung, rộng mở và chia sẻ cùng trẻ bữa ăn dặm vui vẻ.

Cuốn sách không chỉ có khả năng lay chuyển ngành y học hiện đại, mà nó còn sẽ giúp làm biến đổi hoàn toàn cuộc sống của muôn người - bao gồm chính bạn!</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Ngành y học thế giới đã có nhiều bước phát triển vượt bậc trong những năm qua: giảm thiểu tỉ lệ tử vong trẻ sơ sinh, nâng cao tỉ lệ sống sót sau chấn thương, chữa trị và kiểm soát được nhiều loại bệnh tật - kể cả nhiều căn bệnh từng được xem là không có thuốc chữa trong quá khứ. Nhưng dù có bành trướng hùng mạnh đến đâu, y học vẫn muôn đời bất lực trước quy luật sinh-lão-bệnh-tử bất biến của con người: Mỗi khi con người phải đối diện với Tuổi Già và Cái Chết, những công cụ y học vốn dĩ quyền năng bỗng chốc phản bội lại chính lý tưởng cứu nhân độ thế mà chúng đang phục vụ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Bằng những công trình nghiên cứu khoa học giá trị và những câu chuyện sống động từ các bệnh nhân và người thân của chính mình, bác sĩ Gawande bóc trần cho chúng ta thấy những hệ lụy và nỗi đau mà con người phải gánh chịu bởi nghịch lý trên. Viện dưỡng lão vốn dĩ được lập ra với mục đích ban đầu tốt đẹp là giúp cho người cao tuổi có một cuộc sống hạnh phúc và viên mãn bất chấp tuổi già, nhưng nhiều nhà dưỡng lão ngày nay bị biến tướng thành những tòa nhà khép kín không khác gì nhà tù, nơi mà người già không được phép ăn những món ăn họ thích và không được phép làm những gì mình muốn. Nhiều bác sĩ được đào tạo xuất sắc về mặt chuyên môn, nhưng lại không biết cách làm thế nào để nói cho bệnh nhân biết sự thật về bệnh tình của họ; thay vào đó, bác sĩ lại vin vào những hy vọng hão huyền về khả năng cứu sống người bệnh của y học và đề xuất cho bệnh nhân hàng loạt biện pháp chữa trị để nuôi những hy vọng hão đó. Rốt cuộc, hành động này chỉ khiến cho người bệnh và cả thân nhân của họ thêm hao mòn khổ sở chứ không hề mang lại ích lợi gì cho họ cả về mặt thể xác lẫn tinh thần.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trong những cuốn sách của mình, bác sĩ phẫu thuật <strong>Atul Gawande</strong> đã dùng ngòi bút mạnh mẽ không chút sợ hãi của mình tiết lộ cho chúng ta biết sự thật đằng sau ngành y cũng như những cuộc chiến mà các thầy thuốc như ông phải đối mặt và tranh đấu vượt qua. Lần này, với tác phẩm <strong>Ai rồi cũng chết!</strong>, ông phơi bày cho chúng ta thấy những giới hạn và nhược điểm của ngành y - trong cả chuyên môn của ông lẫn những chuyên ngành khác - khi cuộc sống con người bị đe dọa bởi sự lão hóa và cái chết. Qua đó, ông cũng đồng thời khám phá ra rằng mọi chuyện đều có cách giải quyết, rằng chúng ta hoàn toàn có thể làm khác đi, để mang lại cuộc sống tốt đẹp hơn cho mọi người cũng như cho chính bản thân chúng ta.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Để khai phá ngọn nguồn mọi vấn đề cũng như giải pháp, bác sĩ Gawande đã theo chân một nữ y tá làm công việc chăm sóc bệnh nhân tại gia, phỏng vấn nhiều người trong giới bác sĩ lão khoa và sinh hoạt cùng họ, và tiếp xúc với những nhà quản lý viện dưỡng lão có tư tưởng cấp tiến và nhân văn. Ông tìm thấy những con người biết cách nói lên sự thật và chứng minh cho cả thế giới thấy, rằng mỗi người chúng ta đều có thể và có quyền mưu cầu cho mình một cuộc sống tốt đẹp và hạnh phúc bất chấp tuổi già sức yếu mà không phải hy sinh những giá trị sống mà chúng ta yêu quý hoặc tôn thờ.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Với cách kể chuyện chân thực, sống động, mê hoặc và đánh động lòng người của tác giả, quyển sách <strong>Ai rồi cũng chết!</strong>khẳng định với chúng ta rằng: Mỗi con người sinh ra không phải chỉ để ăn, ngủ hay tồn tại qua ngày, mà chính là để được sống một cuộc sống đúng nghĩa; rằng mục đích cuối cùng của y học không phải để kéo dài sự tồn tại vô nghĩa của con người, mà chính là để giúp chúng ta có một cuộc sống mãi mãi đong đầy hạnh phúc - cho đến tận phút lâm chung!</p>', '2016-09-14', 0, 25, 77, 29, 'NXB Thông Tin & Truyền Thông', 'null', 510, 6, 127200, 159000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/ai-roi-cung-chet.u547.d20160926.t093311.121337.png', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Toland phân tích cặn kẽ con đường tiến thân của Hitler từ thời niên thiếu, trưởng thành cho tới khi đứng trên đỉnh cao tội ác cùng những yếu tố ngoại cảnh ảnh hưởng tới tâm lý và những tội ác mà ông ta gây ra cho nhân loại nói chung và dân tộc Do thái nói riêng.</p>  <p>Bằng những nỗ lực không mệt mỏi, John Toland đã tạo nên một trong những tác phẩm đồ sộ và chi tiết nhất mà nhân loại từng có về Adolf Hitler.

Gần như Stephen Covey đã dành cả cuộc đời mình để nghiên cứu về tính hiệu quả của con người, để đi tìm câu trả lời cho ba câu hỏi lớn lao, đó là: "Vì sao con người ta trở nên ít hiệu quả?", "Điều gì làm cho con người ta trở nên hiệu quả cao?" và "Điều gì tạo nên hiệu quả bền vững?", và "7 Habits" chính là sự đúc kết sự nghiệp nghiên cứu cả đời của &ocirocirc;ng cho ba câu hỏi mang tính "muôn đời" đó.</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Mơ ước của hầu hết mọi người trong đời là trở thành một con người thành công và hạnh phúc bằng chính tài năng và đạo đức của mình. Ở bình diện tổ chức hay các quốc gia cũng vậy. Một tổ chức hay quốc gia càng có nhiều người hướng đến thành công bằng tài năng và đạo đức, tổ chức hay quốc gia đó càng có cơ hội phát triển thịnh vượng và văn minh. Tài năng và đạo đức đã trở thành những phẩm chất được tìm kiếm và tôn vinh hàng đầu trong mọi xã hội và mọi thời đại, và chúng có một mối liên quan chặt chẽ với với hiệu quả và hiệu quả bền vững. Cần có tài năng thì mới tạo ra được hiệu quả, cần có đạo đức thì mới tạo ra được hiệu quả bền vững. Và ngược lại, không ai có thể được xem là tài năng nếu không tạo ra hiệu quả, cũng như không ai có thể được coi là có đạo đức nếu như việc tạo ra hiệu quả đó chỉ là nhất thời chứ không mang tính bền vững, bởi lẽ, để tạo ra hiệu quả bền vững thì luôn phải dựa trên nền tảng đạo đức. Vì thế, câu trả lời về "hiệu quả" cũng chính là "lời đáp" cho câu chuyện về tài năng và đạo đức mà nhiều người tìm kiếm, mà lại là một "lời đáp" được đúc kết bằng việc chuyển hóa một hệ thống giá trị ở bên trong để hình thành bản tính thành công bền vững của con người, chứ hoàn toàn không phải là những chiêu trò hay thủ thuật ở bên ngoài.</em></p>  <p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Stephen Covey từng nói rằng, ông không phát minh hay tạo ra "7 Habits", mà "7 Habits" được đưa ra dựa trên những giá trị phổ quát và những nguyên tắc trường tồn của nhân loại. Chính trong thái độ khiêm nhường đó, ta nhận ra tầm vóc của ông. Vì ông đã tạo ra một cầu nối giữa chúng ta với những tri thức tinh hoa của nhân loại về làm người, về giá trị sống, và nhất là về tính hiệu quả. Thường những tri thức này không phải là thứ dễ tiếp cận, dễ tiếp thu với đại chúng, nhưng bằng việc sắp xếp và tổng hợp chúng trong một hình hài có tính hệ thống và tính ứng dụng cao, ông đã góp phần đưa những tinh hoa tri thức đó đến với công chúng dễ dàng hơn. Và cũng bởi được xây dựng dựa trên những gì phổ quát và trường tồn nên "7 Habits" mới trở thành một nền văn hóa vượt không gian, vượt thời gian, dành cho tất cả mọi người, mọi tổ chức và mọi xứ sở. Bất kỳ ai cài đặt nền văn hóa "7 habits" này vào và sống hàng ngày với nền văn hóa đó, thì dù là một tổng thống, một <a href="http://tiki.vn/doanh-nhan/c483">doanh nhân</a>, một quản lý hay một đầu bếp, một nhân viên… cũng sẽ trở nên hiệu quả hơn hẳn…</em></p>', '2017-01-14', 0, NULL, 66, 25, 'NXB Tổng hợp TP.HCM', 'null', 470, 4, 96000, 120000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/7h-goc-nghieng.u547.d20170112.t084850.476475.png', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),

Nhưng cũng có thể nói, cảm giác vượt qua khó khăn rất thú vị. Khi nhà máy hoàn thành, nhìn thấy ngàn nhân viên trong dây chuyền sản xuất, và cầm trên tay từng sản phẩm mới ra lò, tôi thấy rất hãnh diện. Trong ngày khánh thành, khi mọi quan khách đã về hết, tôi leo lên chòi canh của nhà máy, để hồn bay cao suy ngẫm về “nghề” hay “nghiệp” kinh doanh và vị trí của mình trên dòng nước xoáy.</p>  <p>Cảm giác này là động lực thúc đẩy tôi trong những lần thất bại hay thành công về sau. Tôi thấy động lực thúc đẩy tôi trong những lần thất bại hay thành công về sau. Tôi thấy chỉ có cảm giác lớn hơn trong đời là ngày đầu tiên tôi được làm cha mà thôi.

Hầu hết chúng ta đều thấy rằng việc đối đáp ngẫu hứng giữa hai người với nhau chẳng có gì khó. Tuy vậy, khi chất lượng của bài nói ứng khẩu đóng vai trò quyết định, việc trình bày bài nói ấy lại là một vấn đề không hề nhỏ.  Bạn thấy sao khi được yêu cầu phát biểu không chuẩn bị trước lần đầu tiên trong đời? Một câu trả lời trong một buổi phỏng vấn xin việc có thể quyết định việc bạn có nhận được công việc bạn hằng mơ ước hay không? Một câu trả lời có thể quyết định cách các khách hàng tiềm năng đánh giá năng lực của bạn. Một câu trả lời trong các cuộc phản biện được tường thuật có thể quyết định việc bạn có thể trở thành tổng thống... Dù bạn làm việc gì đi nữa, bạn cũng đều gặp phải những tình huống buộc bạn phải ứng khẩu, và thành công trong cuộc sống có thể được định đoạt bởi kỹ năng đối đáp ứng khẩu của bạn. Những người ứng khẩu giỏi vô cùng thành công với các bài phỏng vấn truyền hình, các sự kiện doanh nghiệp, hay thậm chí là với cả những bài phát biểu có chuẩn bị. Khán giả thích những diễn giả có khả năng trình diễn ngay tức thì mà không cần tới kịch bản. Những người có thể nói mà không chuẩn bị trước là những người giao tiếp vượt trội, họ sáng tạo hơn và có cuộc sống linh động và thú vị hơn.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Có một tin tốt cho bạn đó là bạn có thể trở thành những diễn giả ứng khẩu xuất sắc trong một thời gian ngắn nếu các bạn đi theo đúng quy trình. Nếu bạn hỏi tôi, “Andrii, kỹ thuật nào là kỹ thuật quan trọng nhất cần nhớ để trở thành diễn giả ứng khẩu tầm cỡ thế giới?” Chắc chắn tôi sẽ nói, “Hãy xem bài nói ứng khẩu như một cuộc chơi. Thái độ của bạn sẽ chuyển hướng tâm trí bạn và thay vào việc tập trung vào sự khó khăn trong việc tìm ra những từ thích hợp, bộ não của bạn sẽ lo việc truyền tải câu trả lời tốt nhất.” Trong 10 năm gần đây, tôi đã góp nhặt những mẹo nhỏ, kỹ thuật và chiến lược có thể nâng cao trình độ của bất kỳ diễn giả nào trong mảng ứng khẩu một cách đáng kể. Mục tiêu của tôi là gây dựng nên một hệ thống xuyên suốt có thể biến bất kỳ ai thành một diễn giả ứng khẩu tầm cỡ thế giới trong một khoảng thời gian ngắn. Hệ thống Ma thuật của phép ứng khẩu được dựa trên những phân tích của hàng nghìn các cuộc thi nói ứng khẩu, các cuộc phỏng vấn, tranh luận và các chương trình Hỏi &amp; Đáp. Kết quả vô cùng bất ngờ. Các học viên của Ma thuật của phép ứng khẩu cho biết không chỉ khả năng nói không chuẩn bị của họ tăng đáng kể trong giai đoạn 2 th&aacaacute;ng, mà cuộc sống của họ cũng thay đổi theo chiều hướng tốt lên.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Trung bình những người ứng khẩu tốt thăng tiến nhanh hơn, thú vị hơn với mọi người xung quanh và sáng tạo hơn với cuộc sống thường nhật.  Hệ thống được mô tả trong cuốn sách này bao gồm những kỹ thuật hiệu quả nhất không chỉ giới hạn trong phạm vi của phép ứng khẩu, mà còn cả trong diễn xuất, hài nói, tâm lý học ứng dụng và tư duy sáng tạo.  Một khi bạn đã làm chủ được hệ thống này, bạn sẽ phát triển khả năng ứng khẩu của mình một cách không giới hạn. Khán giả của bạn sẽ nghĩ rằng điều bạn làm được trên sân khấu mà không cần mất nhiều thời gian chuẩn bị đơn giản là một sự kỳ diệu và họ sẽ ghi nhớ những điều bạn nói trong nhiều năm.</p>  <p style="text-align: justify;">Sau khi bạn làm chủ được tất cả các yếu tố kỳ diệu của hệ thống Ma thuật của phép ứng khẩu, khán giả của bạn sẽ mong muốn được nghe đi nghe lại bạn nói trong các buổi phỏng vấn, các bữa tiệc cưới hay các cuộc thi tài. Ma thuật phát biểu trước công chúng là một hệ thống dễ hiểu đi từng bước một giúp bạn xây dựng các bài phát biểu hiệu quả. Hệ thống này dựa trên nghiên cứu từ top 1000 diễn giả của thế giới hiện đại. Các kỹ thuật bạn sẽ được học được kiểm chứng trên hàng trăm diễn giả chuyên nghiệp và đã thành công! Bạn sẽ nhận được các bước chính xác cần thiết để tạo nên một bài phát biểu khiến khán giả của bạn phải căng tai tập trung lắng nghe. Đây là một cuốn sách dễ theo dõi, đọc rất thú vị và trong đó có sử dụng nhiều ví dụ từ các bài phát biểu có thật. Hệ thống này sẽ đảm bảo rằng mỗi lần bạn bước lên sân khấu, bạn sẽ luôn đưa ra một bài phát biểu xuất sắc.  Ma thuật của phép ứng khẩu đã tạo nên điều thần diệu cho tôi, tạo nên điều thần diệu cho tất cả những người học nó, và nó cũng sẽ tạo ra điều thần diệu cho bạn.</p>', '2010-01-14', 0, NULL, NULL, 15, 'null', 'null', NULL, 0, 31000, 39000, '/storage/app/hinh-anh/anh-bia/ma-thuat-dien-thuyet.jpg', NULL, '2017-05-27 14:40:25', '2017-05-27 14:40:25'),
